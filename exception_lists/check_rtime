# Userland consolidation global file - this contains information applicable
# to all (or at least very many) components, mainly about things from other
# consolidations.  Overrides specific to a component should go in the
# test/check_rtime file in that component's directory.

#
# This file provides exceptions to the usual rules applied to ELF objects by
# check_rtime. All strings are Perl regular expressions that are compared to
# file paths. In addition to the standard Perl syntax, there is one extension:
#
#	MACH(dir)
#
# is expanded into a regular expression that matches the given
# directory, or a 64-bit subdirectory of the directory with the
# name of a 64-bit architecture. For example, MACH(lib) will match
# any of the following:
#
#	lib
#	lib/amd64
#	lib/sparcv9
#

# Objects that used to contain system functionality that has since
# migrated to libc. We preserve these libraries as pure filters for
# backward compatibility but nothing needs to link to them.

# Files for which we skip checking of duplicate addresses in the
# symbol sort sections. Such exceptions should be rare --- most code will
# not have duplicate addresses, since it takes assembler or a "#pragma weak"
# to do such aliasing in C. C++ is different: The compiler generates aliases
# for implementation reasons, and the mangled names used to encode argument
# and return value types are difficult to handle well in mapfiles.
#
# We don't want to maintain a list of every C++ binary in Userland, so we
# skip them all here for now, until we can find some way to auto-exclude them.
