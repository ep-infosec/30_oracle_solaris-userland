  See tidy.h for the copyright notice.

  Defines HTML Tidy API implemented by tidy library.

  Very rough initial cut for discussion purposes.

  Public interface is const-correct and doesn't explicitly depend
  on any globals.  Thus, thread-safety may be introduced w/out
  changing the interface.

  Looking ahead to a C++ wrapper, C functions always pass
  this-equivalent as 1st arg.
