Bash test results are stored in test/*/test-64-results. They are then filtered
by COMPONENT_TEST_TRANSFORMS to make the test produce stable/reproducible
results. Currently all tests are passing. After bash50-002 upstream patch
application the bug in the bash Makefile causes some of the build targets to
rebuild each time gmake is issued. COMPONENT_TEST_TRANSFORMS are used to get
rid of this part from the test output.


Please note that the tests have to be executed from tty, otherwise this two
tests fail:

run-execscript
run-read


To test new version of bash installed on new machine I did:

- install new bash
- reboot
- svcs -x # to see if it caused any issue
- bash --version
  - to see if we are testing right bash version
