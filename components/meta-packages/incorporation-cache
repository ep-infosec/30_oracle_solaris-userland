# This file specifies additional packages to be included when the
# userland-incorporator runs to generate incorporations, to allow packages
# which were not built in the Userland gate to be incorporated.
#
# Adding packages to this file should be a very rare occasion discussed
# first with the gatekeepers, generally only for special cases like merging
# consolidations or special builds that cannot be part of the main Userland
# gate build for some reason.
#
# Packages should be removed from this file when they are integrated to the
# normal Userland gate builds.
#
# lines are in the format:
#    incorporation-name:package@version
# or for platform-specific entries:
#    incorporation-name:package@version=arch
# lines beginning with hash (#) are ignored
