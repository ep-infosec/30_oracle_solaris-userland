This test should produce no other output than this message, and a final "OK".
(Note that the test can take an hour or more to run and periodically stops
for as long as one minute.  Do not assume there is a problem just because
nothing seems to happen for a long time.  If you cannot live without
running status, try the command: `tail -f check.log' from another window.)
OK, all 3578 tests passed (11 test groups skipped).
