Unzip supports -I/-O options which allows to unpack archives packed in different
localization environment. To test it there are two archives. One in EUC-JP (ISO)
for -I and another one in cp932 (OEM) for -O. To see reference output look on:

 LC_CHARSET=utf-8 cat files/out.txt

Please note:
It is really important to do all checks in utf8 environment where unzip converts
given sets into utf8. In files/out.txt are also exmples of options to list archives.
Graphic output is in files/good.png for reference.
