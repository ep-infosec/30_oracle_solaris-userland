# Skip test because of set up requirements.
#
# The upstream archive includes a test script (test.sh), which tries to run
# "openssl ocsp" command multiple times. However, it assumes that we already
# have necessary pem files (keys/certificates for CA, ocspd daemon, and others,
# and also the CRL), and those files are not included in the archive.
#
# To test manually, follow a guide document for the smartcard project.
