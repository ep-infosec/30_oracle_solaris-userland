# You can use these guides for tmux testing:
# https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/
# https://robots.thoughtbot.com/a-tmux-crash-course

# start tmux with named session
tmux new -s test

# tmux is using prefix key and command key
# by default prefix key is ctrl+b (C-b)

# split view into two panes
#> C-b %
#> C-b "

#navigate panes with arrow
#> C-b up
#> C-b left

# test some simple commands in each pane
echo "Hi this is tmux"
grep root /etc/passwd
gdate

# detach current session
$> C-b d

# start tmux again with other session
tmux new -s test2

# to create multiple windows
#> C-b c

# switch between windows
# you should see multiple windows on the bottom ([0] 0:bash- 1:bash*)
#> C-b n
#> C-b p

# try some simple commands in both windows

# switch to previous session
tmux switch -t test

# list all current sessions
tmux list-sessions

# exit this session and attach the first one
exit
tmux attach -t test2
