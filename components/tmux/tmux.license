     Versions of malloc and friends that check their results, and never return
     failure (they call fatalx if they encounter an error).

     As far as I am concerned, the code I have written for this software
     can be used freely for any purpose.  Any derived versions of this
     software must be clearly marked as such, and if the derived work is
     incompatible with the protocol description in the RFC file, it must be
     called by a name other than "ssh" or "Secure Shell".
