In Solaris 11.4, we have normalized man pages. See PSARC 2015/428.
This means that what was section 1m, is now section 8 and what was
section 4 is now section 5. But currently only for Solaris 11.4.

This patch should eventually be sent upstream, but for that to happen
it will need to be reworked into a form that will be acceptable for
all versions of Solaris. Until then, we are just using this Solaris 11.4
specific patch.
