/* With all write APIs if image is in one of the linear formats with 16-bit
 * data then setting convert_to_8_bit will cause the output to be an 8-bit PNG
 * gamma encoded according to the sRGB specification, otherwise a 16-bit linear
 * encoded PNG file is written.
 *
 * With color-mapped data formats the colormap parameter point to a color-map
 * with at least image->colormap_entries encoded in the specified format.  If
 * the format is linear the written PNG color-map will be converted to sRGB
 * regardless of the convert_to_8_bit flag.
 *
 * With all APIs row_stride is handled as in the read APIs - it is the spacing
 * from one row to the next in component sized units (1 or 2 bytes) and if
 * negative indicates a bottom-up row layout in the buffer.  If row_stride is
 * zero, libpng will calculate it for you from the image width and number of
 * channels.
 *
 * Note that the write API does not support interlacing, sub-8-bit pixels or
 * most ancillary chunks.  If you need to write text chunks (e.g. for copyright
 * notices) you need to use one of the other APIs.

/* WARNING: The type of JPEG encapsulation defined by the TIFF Version 6.0
   specification is now totally obsolete and deprecated for new applications and
   images. This file was was created solely in order to read unconverted images
   still present on some users' computer systems. It will never be extended
   to write such files. Writing new-style JPEG compressed TIFFs is implemented
   in tif_jpeg.c.

   The code is carefully crafted to robustly read all gathered JPEG-in-TIFF
   testfiles, and anticipate as much as possible all other... But still, it may
   fail on some. If you encounter problems, please report them on the TIFF
   mailing list and/or to Joris Van Damme <info@awaresystems.be>.

   Please read the file called "TIFF Technical Note #2" if you need to be
   convinced this compression scheme is bad and breaks TIFF. That document
   is linked to from the LibTiff site <http://www.remotesensing.org/libtiff/>
   and from AWare Systems' TIFF section
   <http://www.awaresystems.be/imaging/tiff.html>. It is also absorbed
   in Adobe's specification supplements, marked "draft" up to this day, but
   supported by the TIFF community.

   This file interfaces with Release 6B of the JPEG Library written by the
   Independent JPEG Group. Previous versions of this file required a hack inside
   the LibJpeg library. This version no longer requires that. Remember to
   remove the hack if you update from the old version.
