To test, on a system where you can hear the audio output (i.e. not on a build
server unless you're in the machine room and have hooked up speakers loud enough
to hear over the fan noise):

% espeak "hello world"

Alternatively, if no audio devices are available, you can redirect speech into
a file and listen to it on another machine with speakers.

% espeak "hello world" --stdout > output.wav
