.SH "NAME"
speex \- speex\&.org A Free Codec For Free Speech
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBspeex\fR is an Open Source/Free Software audio compression format
designed for speech\&. The Speex Project aims to lower the barrier of
entry for voice applications by providing a free alternative to
expensive proprietary speech codecs\&. Moreover, Speex is well-adapted
to Internet applications and provides useful features that are not
present in most other codecs\&. Finally, Speex is part of the GNU
Project and is available under the revised BSD license\&.
.PP
In essence, Speex is to speech what Vorbis is to audio/music\&. Unlike
many other speech codecs, Speex is not designed for mobile phones but
rather for packet networks and voice over IP (VoIP) applications\&.
File-based compression is of course also supported\&.
