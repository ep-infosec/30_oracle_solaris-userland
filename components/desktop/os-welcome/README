This package is a couple small python GUI programs and some accompanying HTML
pages to display information about the OS and provide guidance on how to start
using the desktop.

Versions 1.1.10 and earlier were maintained as a standalone project in a
separate source repository on opensolaris.org.  After opensolaris.org was shut
down, further updates were made as patches applied in the desktop spec-files.

Version 1.2.0 drops the separate repository, incorporates the patches
previously applied in the spec-files, and just checks the files directly
into the Userland gate.  The ChangeLog from the prior versions is provided 
to retain some history - for more history, there is a mirror on github of
the former opensolaris.org svn repo.

Version 1.3.0 migrates both Python scripts to Python 3.7 and fixes many issues
introduced due to PyGTK changes and deprecations.  Application logos were
updated to better resolution and now conform with new Redwood graphic design.
