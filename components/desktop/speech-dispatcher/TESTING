To test, on a system where you can hear the audio output (i.e. not on a build
server unless you're in the machine room and have hooked up speakers loud enough
to hear over the fan noise):

% spd-say "hello world"

If it doesn't work, you can run "speech-dispatcher -D" to generate debug logs
in /tmp/speechd-debug/.
