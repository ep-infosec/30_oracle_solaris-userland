 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301 USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
	51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations
below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must
be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
    performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
of the ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
notice is found.


    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James
  Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!


---------

All PulseAudio source files, except as noted below, are licensed under the GNU
Lesser General Public License. (see file LGPL for details)

However, the server side has optional GPL dependencies.  These include the
libsamplerate and gdbm (core libraries), LIRC (lirc module) and FFTW (equalizer
module), although others may also be included in the future.  If PulseAudio is
compiled with these optional components, this effectively downgrades the
license of the server part to GPL (see the file GPL for details), exercising
section 3 of the LGPL.  In such circumstances, you should treat the client
library (libpulse) of PulseAudio as being LGPL licensed and the server part
(libpulsecore) as being GPL licensed.  Since the PulseAudio daemon, tests,
various utilities/helpers and the modules link to libpulsecore and/or the afore
mentioned optional GPL dependencies they are of course also GPL licensed also
in this scenario.

In addition to this, if D-Bus support is enabled, the PulseAudio client library
(libpulse) MAY need to be licensed under the GPL, depending on the license
adopted for libdbus. libdbus is licensed under either of the Academic Free
License 2.1 or GPL 2.0 or above. Which of these applies is your choice, and the
result affects the licensing of libpulse and thus, potentially, all programs
that link to libpulse.

Andre Adrian's echo cancellation implementation is licensed under a less
restrictive license - see src/modules/echo-cancel/adrian-license.txt for
details.

Some other files pulled into PA source (i.e. reference implementations that are
considered too small and stable to be considered as an external library) use the
more permissive MIT license. These include the device reservation DBus protocol
and realtime kit implementations.

A more permissive BSD-style license is used for LFE filters, see
src/pulsecore/filter/LICENSE.WEBKIT for details.

Additionally, a more permissive Sun license is used for code that performs
u-law, A-law and linear PCM conversions.

While we attempt to provide a summary here, it is the ultimate responsibility of
the packager to ensure the components they use in their build of PulseAudio
meets their license requirements.

 General power management rules:

   When SUSPENDED we close the audio device.

   We make no difference between IDLE and RUNNING in our handling.

   As long as we are in RUNNING/IDLE state we will *always* write data to
   the device. If none is available from the inputs, we write silence
   instead.

   If power should be saved on IDLE module-suspend-on-idle should be used.

 Openssl 1.1.0 broke compatibility. Before 1.1.0 we had to set RSA->n and
 RSA->e manually, but after 1.1.0 the RSA struct is opaque and we have to use
 RSA_set0_key(). RSA_set0_key() is a new function added in 1.1.0. We could
 depend on openssl 1.1.0, but it may take some time before distributions will
 be able to upgrade to the new openssl version. To insulate ourselves from
 such transition problems, let's implement RSA_set0_key() ourselves if it's
 * not available.

 \section intro_sec Introduction

 This document describes the client API for the PulseAudio sound
 server. The API comes in two flavours to accommodate different styles
 of applications and different needs in complexity:

 \li The complete but somewhat complicated to use asynchronous API
 \li The simplified, easy to use, but limited synchronous API

 All strings in PulseAudio are in the UTF-8 encoding, regardless of current
 locale. Some functions will filter invalid sequences from the string, some
 will simply fail. To ensure reliable behaviour, make sure everything you
 pass to the API is already in UTF-8.

 \section simple_sec Simple API

 Use this if you develop your program in synchronous style and just
 need a way to play or record data on the sound server. See
 \subpage simple for more details.

 \section async_sec Asynchronous API

 Use this if you develop your programs in asynchronous, event loop
 based style or if you want to use the advanced features of the
 PulseAudio API. A guide can be found in \subpage async.

 By using the built-in threaded main loop, it is possible to achieve a
 pseudo-synchronous API, which can be useful in synchronous applications
 where the simple API is insufficient. See the \ref async page for
 details.

 \section thread_sec Threads

 The PulseAudio client libraries are not designed to be directly
 thread-safe. They are however designed to be reentrant and
 threads-aware.

 To use the libraries in a threaded environment, you must assure that
 all objects are only used in one thread at a time. Normally, this means
 that all objects belonging to a single context must be accessed from the
 same thread.

 The included main loop implementation is also not thread safe. Take care
 to make sure event objects are not manipulated when any other code is
 using the main loop.

 \section error_sec Error Handling

 Every function should explicitly document how errors are reported to
 the caller. Unfortunately, currently a lot of that documentation is
 missing. Here is an overview of the general conventions used.

 The PulseAudio API indicates error conditions by returning a negative
 integer value or a NULL pointer. On success, zero or a positive integer
 value or a valid pointer is returned.

 Functions of the \ref simple API generally return -1 or NULL on failure and
 can optionally store an error code (see ::pa_error_code) using a pointer
 argument.

 Functions of the \ref async API return an negative error code or NULL on
 failure (see ::pa_error_code). In the later case, pa_context_errno()
 can be used to obtain the error code of the last failed operation.

 An error code can be turned into a human readable message using
 pa_strerror().

 \section logging_sec Logging

 You can configure different logging parameters for the PulseAudio client
 libraries. The following environment variables are recognized:

  - `PULSE_LOG`: Maximum log level required. Bigger values result in a
     more verbose logging output. The following values are recognized:
     + `0`: Error messages
     + `1`: Warning messages
     + `2`: Notice messages
     + `3`: Info messages
     + `4`: Debug messages
  - `PULSE_LOG_SYSLOG`: If defined, force all client libraries to log
     their output using the syslog(3) mechanism. Default behavior is to
     log all output to stderr.
  - `PULSE_LOG_JOURNAL`: If defined, force all client libraries to log
     their output using the systemd journal. If both `PULSE_LOG_JOURNAL`
     and `PULSE_LOG_SYSLOG` are defined, logging to the systemd journal
     takes a higher precedence. Each message originating library file name
     and function are included by default through the journal fields
     `CODE_FILE`, `CODE_FUNC`, and `CODE_LINE`. Any backtrace attached to
     the logging message is sent through the PulseAudio-specific journal
     field `PULSE_BACKTRACE`. This environment variable has no effect if
     PulseAudio was compiled without systemd journal support.
  - `PULSE_LOG_COLORS`: If defined, enables colored logging output.
  - `PULSE_LOG_TIME`: If defined, include timestamps with each message.
  - `PULSE_LOG_FILE`: If defined, include each message originating file
     name.
  - `PULSE_LOG_META`: If defined, include each message originating file
     name and path relative to the PulseAudio source tree root.
  - `PULSE_LOG_LEVEL`: If defined, include a log level prefix with each
     message. Respectively, the prefixes "E", "W", "N", "I", "D" stands
     for Error, Warning, Notice, Info, and Debugging.
  - `PULSE_LOG_BACKTRACE`: Number of functions to display in the backtrace.
     If this variable is not defined, or has a value of zero, no backtrace
     is shown.
  - `PULSE_LOG_BACKTRACE_SKIP`: Number of backtrace levels to skip, from
     the function printing the log message downwards.
  - `PULSE_LOG_NO_RATE_LIMIT`: If defined, do not rate limit the logging
     output. Rate limiting skips certain log messages when their frequency
     is considered too high.

 \section pkgconfig pkg-config

 The PulseAudio libraries provide pkg-config snippets for the different
 modules:

 \li libpulse - The asynchronous API and the internal main loop implementation.
 \li libpulse-mainloop-glib - GLIB 2.x main loop bindings.
 \li libpulse-simple - The simple PulseAudio API.

* \page threaded_mainloop Threaded Main Loop

 \section overv_sec Overview

 The threaded main loop implementation is a special version of the primary
 main loop implementation (see \ref mainloop). For the basic design, see
 its documentation.

 The added feature in the threaded main loop is that it spawns a new thread
 that runs the real main loop. This allows a synchronous application to use
 the asynchronous API without risking stalling the PulseAudio library.

 \section creat_sec Creation

 A pa_threaded_mainloop object is created using pa_threaded_mainloop_new().
 This will only allocate the required structures though, so to use it the
 thread must also be started. This is done through
 pa_threaded_mainloop_start(), after which you can start using the main loop.

 \section destr_sec Destruction

 When the PulseAudio connection has been terminated, the thread must be
 stopped and the resources freed. Stopping the thread is done using
 pa_threaded_mainloop_stop(), which must be called without the lock (see
 below) held. When that function returns, the thread is stopped and the
 pa_threaded_mainloop object can be freed using pa_threaded_mainloop_free().

 \section lock_sec Locking

 Since the PulseAudio API doesn't allow concurrent accesses to objects,
 a locking scheme must be used to guarantee safe usage. The threaded main
 loop API provides such a scheme through the functions
 pa_threaded_mainloop_lock() and pa_threaded_mainloop_unlock().

 The lock is recursive, so it's safe to use it multiple times from the same
 thread. Just make sure you call pa_threaded_mainloop_unlock() the same
 number of times you called pa_threaded_mainloop_lock().

 The lock needs to be held whenever you call any PulseAudio function that
 uses an object associated with this main loop. Make sure you do not hold
 on to the lock more than necessary though, as the threaded main loop stops
 while the lock is held.

 Example:

 \code
 void my_check_stream_func(pa_threaded_mainloop *m, pa_stream *s) {
     pa_stream_state_t state;

     pa_threaded_mainloop_lock(m);

     state = pa_stream_get_state(s);

     pa_threaded_mainloop_unlock(m);

     if (state == PA_STREAM_READY)
         printf("Stream is ready!");
     else
         printf("Stream is not ready!");
 }
 \endcode

 \section cb_sec Callbacks

 Callbacks in PulseAudio are asynchronous, so they require extra care when
 using them together with a threaded main loop.

 The easiest way to turn the callback based operations into synchronous
 ones, is to simply wait for the callback to be called and continue from
 there. This is the approach chosen in PulseAudio's threaded API.

 \subsection basic_subsec Basic callbacks

 For the basic case, where all that is required is to wait for the callback
 to be invoked, the code should look something like this:

 Example:

 \code
 static void my_drain_callback(pa_stream *s, int success, void *userdata) {
     pa_threaded_mainloop *m;

     m = userdata;
     assert(m);

     pa_threaded_mainloop_signal(m, 0);
 }

 void my_drain_stream_func(pa_threaded_mainloop *m, pa_stream *s) {
     pa_operation *o;

     pa_threaded_mainloop_lock(m);

     o = pa_stream_drain(s, my_drain_callback, m);
     assert(o);

     while (pa_operation_get_state(o) == PA_OPERATION_RUNNING)
         pa_threaded_mainloop_wait(m);

     pa_operation_unref(o);

     pa_threaded_mainloop_unlock(m);
 }
 \endcode

 The main function, my_drain_stream_func(), will wait for the callback to
 be called using pa_threaded_mainloop_wait().

 If your application is multi-threaded, then this waiting must be
 done inside a while loop. The reason for this is that multiple
 threads might be using pa_threaded_mainloop_wait() at the same
 time. Each thread must therefore verify that it was its callback
 that was invoked. Also the underlying OS synchronization primitives
 are usually not free of spurious wake-ups, so a
 pa_threaded_mainloop_wait() must be called within a loop even if
 you have only one thread waiting.

 The callback, my_drain_callback(), indicates to the main function that it
 has been called using pa_threaded_mainloop_signal().

 As you can see, pa_threaded_mainloop_wait() may only be called with
 the lock held. The same thing is true for pa_threaded_mainloop_signal(),
 but as the lock is held before the callback is invoked, you do not have to
 deal with that.

 The functions will not dead lock because the wait function will release
 the lock before waiting and then regrab it once it has been signalled.
 For those of you familiar with threads, the behaviour is that of a
 condition variable.

 \subsection data_subsec Data callbacks

 For many callbacks, simply knowing that they have been called is
 insufficient. The callback also receives some data that is desired. To
 access this data safely, we must extend our example a bit:

 \code
 static int * volatile drain_result = NULL;

 static void my_drain_callback(pa_stream*s, int success, void *userdata) {
     pa_threaded_mainloop *m;

     m = userdata;
     assert(m);

     drain_result = &success;

     pa_threaded_mainloop_signal(m, 1);
 }

 void my_drain_stream_func(pa_threaded_mainloop *m, pa_stream *s) {
     pa_operation *o;

     pa_threaded_mainloop_lock(m);

     o = pa_stream_drain(s, my_drain_callback, m);
     assert(o);

     while (drain_result == NULL)
         pa_threaded_mainloop_wait(m);

     pa_operation_unref(o);

     if (*drain_result)
         printf("Success!");
     else
         printf("Bitter defeat...");

     pa_threaded_mainloop_accept(m);

     pa_threaded_mainloop_unlock(m);
 }
 \endcode

 The example is a bit silly as it would probably have been easier to just
 copy the contents of success, but for larger data structures this can be
 wasteful.

 The difference here compared to the basic callback is the value 1 passed
 to pa_threaded_mainloop_signal() and the call to
 pa_threaded_mainloop_accept(). What will happen is that
 pa_threaded_mainloop_signal() will signal the main function and then wait.
 The main function is then free to use the data in the callback until
 pa_threaded_mainloop_accept() is called, which will allow the callback
 to continue.

 Note that pa_threaded_mainloop_accept() must be called some time between
 exiting the while loop and unlocking the main loop! Failure to do so will
 result in a race condition. I.e. it is not ok to release the lock and
 regrab it before calling pa_threaded_mainloop_accept().

 \subsection async_subsec Asynchronous callbacks

 PulseAudio also has callbacks that are completely asynchronous, meaning
 that they can be called at any time. The threaded main loop API provides
 the locking mechanism to handle concurrent accesses, but nothing else.
 Applications will have to handle communication from the callback to the
 main program through their own mechanisms.

 The callbacks that are completely asynchronous are:

 \li State callbacks for contexts, streams, etc.
 \li Subscription notifications
 



 A thread based event loop implementation based on pa_mainloop. The
 event loop is run in a helper thread in the background. A few
 synchronization primitives are available to access the objects
 attached to the event loop safely.

 See also \subpage threaded_mainloop
 

* An opaque threaded main loop object * Signal all threads waiting for a signalling event in
 pa_threaded_mainloop_wait(). If wait_for_accept is non-zero, do
 not return before the signal was accepted by a
 pa_threaded_mainloop_accept() call. While waiting for that condition
 * the event loop object is unlocked.

 Most of the following is blatantly stolen from esound. 

 path and name of the default EsounD domain socket 

 length of the audio buffer size 
 maximum size we can write().  Otherwise we might overflow 

 length of the authentication key, octets 

 default port for the EsounD server 

 default sample rate for the EsounD server 

 maximum length of a stream/sample name 

 a magic number to identify the relative endianness of a client

 Have calling software do it since its already doing a shift
         * from 32-bits down to 16-bits.
         
 pcm_val = pcm_val >> 3; 

 A-law using even bit inversion  Have calling software do it since its already doing a shift
         * from 32-bits down to 16-bits.

 A memblockq is a queue of pa_memchunks (yepp, the name is not
 perfect). It is similar to the ring buffers used by most other
 audio software. In contrast to a ring buffer this memblockq data
 type doesn't need to copy any data around, it just maintains
 * references to reference counted memory blocks.

 OK, we shall do the full monty: upmixing and downmixing. Our
         * algorithm is relatively simple, does not do spacialization, or delay
         * elements. LFE filters are done after the remap step. Patches are always
         * welcome, though. Oh, and it doesn't do any matrix decoding. (Which
         * probably wouldn't make any sense anyway.)
         *
         * This code is not idempotent: downmixing an upmixed stereo stream is
         * not identical to the original. The volume will not match, and the
         * two channels will be a linear combination of both.
         *
         * This is loosely based on random suggestions found on the Internet,
         * such as this:
         * http://www.halfgaar.net/surround-sound-in-linux and the alsa upmix
         * plugin.
         *
         * The algorithm works basically like this:
         *
         * 1) Connect all channels with matching names.
         *
         * 2) Mono Handling:
         *    S:Mono: See setup_oc_mono_map().
         *    D:Mono: Avg all S:channels
         *
         * 3) Mix D:Left, D:Right (if PA_RESAMPLER_NO_FILL_SINK is clear):
         *    D:Left: If not connected, avg all S:Left
         *    D:Right: If not connected, avg all S:Right
         *
         * 4) Mix D:Center (if PA_RESAMPLER_NO_FILL_SINK is clear):
         *    If not connected, avg all S:Center
         *    If still not connected, avg all S:Left, S:Right
         *
         * 5) Mix D:LFE
         *    If not connected, avg all S:*
         *
         * 6) Make sure S:Left/S:Right is used: S:Left/S:Right: If not
         *    connected, mix into all D:left and all D:right channels. Gain is
         *    1/9.
         *
         * 7) Make sure S:Center, S:LFE is used:
         *
         *    S:Center, S:LFE: If not connected, mix into all D:left, all
         *    D:right, all D:center channels. Gain is 0.5 for center and 0.375
         *    for LFE. C-front is only mixed into L-front/R-front if available,
         *    otherwise into all L/R channels. Similarly for C-rear.
         *
         * 8) Normalize each row in the matrix such that the sum for each row is
         *    not larger than 1.0 in order to avoid clipping.
         *
         * S: and D: shall relate to the source resp. destination channels.
         *
         * Rationale: 1, 2 are probably obvious. For 3: this copies front to
         * rear if needed. For 4: we try to find some suitable C source for C,
         * if we don't find any, we avg L and R. For 5: LFE is mixed from all
         * channels. For 6: the rear channels should not be dropped entirely,
         * however have only minimal impact. For 7: movies usually encode
         * speech on the center channel. Thus we have to make sure this channel
         * is distributed to L and R if not available in the output. Also, LFE
         * is used to achieve a greater dynamic range, and thus we should try
         * to do our best to pass it to L+R.
