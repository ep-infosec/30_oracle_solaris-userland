Requirements to transition from one version of OpenLDAP to another.

_Only required if the system is being used as an OpenLDAP server._

Ordinarily a system is being used as an OpenLDAP server when SMF service
instance ldap/server is enabled and online.

The OpenLDAP package has been updated to include a newer version of
OpenLDAP which must be manually migrated to.

To transition from one version of OpenLDAP to the next it is imperative
that databases are exported to LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF) and
imported following the upgrade.  This is a manual procedure and needs to
be completed by a systems administrator before booting into the new boot
environment.

In addition the version of OpenLDAP 2.4.44, and for the foreseeable
future, has switched from using Berkeley DB (BDB) format to the
Lightning Memory-Mapped Database (LMDB) format requiring an additional
configuration change.

This guide explains how to transition to the later version and migrate
your data from the BDB database to LMDB format.  These instructions
assume that slapd's configuration is stored in
/etc/openldap/slapd.conf.

a) Quiesce the service of writes, for example by disabling it:
   ,----
   | svcadm disable ldap/server
   `----

b) Dump database to LDIF file using slapcat(8oldap).

   ,----
   | mkdir -p /var/share/openldap
   | slapcat -l /var/share/openldap/data.ldif
   `----

c) Boot into new boot environment when ready

   ,----
   | reboot
   `----

   Upon reboot the ldap/server service may be in maintenance mode if the
   versions are not compatible.

d) Update slapd configuration files as necessary.

   slapd's configuration may require a couple of minor changes.
   This is necessary to update:
   - TLSProtocolMin : Minimum protocol version (format change).
     - If applicable change setting from "770" to "3.2"
   - database : OpenLDAP database type
     - If applicable change setting from bdb to mdb

   Example: Modifying slapd.conf for use with OpenLDAP 2.4.44 and above.
   ,----
   | # cp /etc/openldap/slapd.conf /etc/openldap/slapd.2430.conf
   | # vi /etc/openldap/slapd.conf
   | # diff /etc/openldap/slapd.2430.conf /etc/openldap/slapd.conf
   | 27c27
   | < TLSProtocolMin        770
   | ---
   | > TLSProtocolMin        3.2
   | 55c55
   | < database      bdb
   | ---
   | > database      mdb
   | #
   `----

e) Remove old database in /var/openldap/openldap-data

   ,----
   | rm -rf /var/openldap/openldap-data/*
   `----

f) Import LDIF data with slapadd(8oldap) as user "openldap".

   Execute from a directory accessible to "openldap" to prevent
   non-toxic (getcwd) error from slapadd.

   ,----
   | cd /tmp
   | su openldap -c "slapadd -l /var/share/openldap/data.ldif"
   `----

g) Enable ldap/server

   ,----
   | svcadm enable ldap/server
   `----

h) Check ldap/server status and log as necessary

   ,----
   | svcs ldap/server
   | svcs -Lv ldap/server
   `----

That concludes the OpenLDAP transition instructions.
