Description: The main goal of this project is to bring the benefits of 
        cloud-init to guests running a wide range of OSs.  The first 
        release provides support for Windows OSs, but due to the modular 
        and decoupled architecture of the service, plugins for any OS 
        can be easily added.

        The features available with the first release include HTTP and 
        ConfigDriveV2 metadata services and plugins for:  hostname, 
        user creation, group membership, static networking, 
        SSH user's public keys, user_data custom scripts running in 
        various shells (CMD.exe / Powershell / bash)

        There's no limitation in the type of supported Hypervisor. This 
        service can be used on instances running on Hyper-V, KVM, Xen, 
        ESXi, etc
