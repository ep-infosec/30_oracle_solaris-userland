.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
rateup is a fast add-on to the great MRTG Traffic monitor. It makes 
the database file updates much faster, and creates the graphic image
files, ready for processing by PPMTOGIF.  It also reduces memory
requirements by a factor of 10, and increases the speed of updates
by a factor of at least 10.  This makes it feasible to run mrtg
every 5 minutes.
.sp
rateup attempts to compensate for missed updates by repeating the last
sample, and also tries to catch bad update times.  The .log file stores
real history every five minutes for 31 hours, then 'compresses' the
history into 30 minute samples for a week, then 2-hour samples for
31 days, then daily samples for two years.  This ensures that the
log files don't grow in size.
.sp
The log files are a slightly different format, but convert.perl
will fix that for you.
