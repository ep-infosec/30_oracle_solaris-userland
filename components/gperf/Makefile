# test/system-test is tricky.
#    Reason being is this component bundles! test results
#    with the source and those results are compared against
#    generated results.
#    Unfortunately these test results embed the string:
#    /* Command-line: ../src/gperf -L C -F ', 0, 0' -j1 -i 1 -g
#    which contains the actual command run: ../src/gperf
#    That string is correct for test but system-test will have /usr/bin/gperf
#    do a sed is run over the bundled test results with /usr/bin/gperf
#    so that an internal compare will pass.
#    Put another way this component does internally what the userland
#    test infrastructure is doing.

# modify bundled test results for system-test
