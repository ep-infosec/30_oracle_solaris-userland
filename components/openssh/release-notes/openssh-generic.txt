Updated versions of OpenSSH may change the default configuration
including addition or removal of ciphers or other features.

If this system has a customised sshd_config(5) or ssh_config(5)
file you should review and may need to update it before using the
updated version of OpenSSH delivered by this package.

Note that users may also have settings in their HOME/.ssh/config
that need updating.

If the sshd_config references features removed by this version the
svc:/network/ssh:default service may be in the maintenance
state on the next reboot or after installation of this package.
