# PAM configuration for the SSH user authentication type of 'none' which is
# used when no authentication is required at all.  This PAM fragment prevents 
# authentication using sshd-none to avoid unnecessary interaction with
# failed logins tracking in certain SSH and PAM configurations.  If SSH
# logins are desired without any authentication then this is possible by
# configuring both the sshd_config(5) options 'PasswordAuthentication' and
# 'PermitEmptyPasswords' to be 'yes' and using either the 'password' or
# 'keyboard-interactive' user authentication methods.
