 Function pointers for core GLX functionality. We can't just link
     against these directly because we need to conditionally load
     libGL when we are using GLX so that it won't conflict with a GLES
     library if we are using EGL + GLES. These are just the functions
     that we want to use before calling glXGetProcAddress
