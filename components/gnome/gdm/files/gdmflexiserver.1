.SH "NAME"
gdmflexiserver \- Runs flexible (on demand) X servers
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBgdmflexiserver\fR [\fB\-\-authenticate\fR] [\fB\-\-command=\fIcommand\fR\fR] [\fB\-\-debug\fR] [\fB\-\-help\fR] [\fB\-\-monte-carlo-pi\fR] [\fB\-\-no-lock\fR] [\fB\-\-version\fR] [\fB\-\-xnest\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgdmflexiserver\fR is primarily used to run flexible (on demand) X
servers via the virtual terminal interface\&.  \fBgdmflexiserver\fR allows a
user to log in once and then quits\&.  This is useful if you are logged in as
user A, and user B wants to log in quickly but user A does not wish to log out\&.
The X server ensures that the virtual terminal switching works transparently\&.
.PP
In GDM 2\&.20 and earlier, \fBgdmflexiserver\fR was the primary interface
for starting flexible X server sessions\&.  In the current version of GDM, the
"User Switcher" panel applet is more typically used for this
purpose when using the GNOME desktop\&.  The \fBgdmflexiserver\fR interface
is provided for backwards compatibility purposes, and to provide an interface
for starting flexible X server sessions when not using the GNOME desktop\&.
.PP
Many of the \fBgdmflexiserver\fR options are no longer supported in GDM
and are ignored if used\&.  For example, GDM 2\&.20 and earlier made use of the
\fB\-\-command\fR option to query information from the GDM daemon and
to control its behavior\&.  Current versions of GDM use D\-Bus for this purpose
and gdmflexiserver now only supports the "VERSION" command\&.
