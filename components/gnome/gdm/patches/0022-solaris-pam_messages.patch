Fix for Oracle Solaris Bug 15919073:
gdm-session-worker fails to handle multiple PAM messages in a single call

Workaround for incompatibility between how Solaris & Linux PAM bundles
multiple messages into a single PAM conversation call, as described in
http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pam_conv.3.html and
http://unixpapa.com/incnote/pam.html .
