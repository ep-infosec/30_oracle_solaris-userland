# Internally developed workaround for some tests hanging
# forever in read or write to Unix Domain Sockets.
#
# An internal bug has been filed for this.
#
# If a modification to how VPATH or $srcdir and *builddir is
# developed that fixes this, then a patch (not this one)
# may be submitted upstream at that time.
