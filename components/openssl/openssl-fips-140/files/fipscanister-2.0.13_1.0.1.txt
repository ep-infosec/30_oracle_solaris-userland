This pkg delivers an updated OpenSSL FIPS 140-2 based on the Oracle OpenSSL FOM 1.0
that includes a workaround for https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/15587
This disables a SPARC specific optimisation for Montgomery multiplication that
could in some cases result in an incorrect result for ECDSA_sign()/ECDSA_verify()
and possibly other algorithms.
To reiterate, this bug is not present in X86 systems, only SPARC.
