+.SH SVCADM RELATED NOTES
+Compared to
+.BR syslogd (8),
+.B rsyslogd
+cannot be forced to reread its configuration file with the SIGHUP signal and because of that
+.B svcadm refresh
+command doesn't do that either.
+
+To do that, you must restart
+.B rsyslogd
+with
+.BR "svcadm restart" .
+.SH NOTES
+When the service is enabled the first time, an attempt is made
+to see if any /etc/syslog.conf (see syslog.conf(5)),
+entries might need migrating and if
+so rsyslog is brought up in a degraded SMF state.
+
+Please visit /etc/rsyslog.conf (see rsyslog.conf(5)), and customize as needed.
+
+Then clear the service:
+
+# svcadm clear svc:/system/system-log:rsyslog
