The patches found here were created to solve some issues in the PKCS#11
middleware for CAC/PIV smartcards source code from:
"The Code Conservatory" http://conservatory.github.io/ 

The issue with this source code used from github
https://github.com/Conservatory/CACKey
appears to have come from merge conflict markers that resulted from the
merge which originally created the repository.

For example, the Makefile ends up with lots of git merge lines such as:
<<<<<< HEAD
>>>>>>> trunk

it seems as though the various merge conflicts arose from the merge and
pull request when the github source repository was attempted to be updated
to latest version of CACKey.

There were a lot of conflict markers resulting from that merge that now
have been resolved with these patches and when applied to the source code,
it will now compile and build on Solaris.
