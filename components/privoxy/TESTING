# Web proxy is running on 127.0.0.1:8118 by default.
# We need to setup Firefox's proxy to verify privoxy functionality:
# 1) "Edit" -> "Preferences" -> Network Settings "Settings" -> Connection Settings;
# 2) use "Manual proxy configuration";
# 3) set HTTP Proxy to 127.0.0.1 and port to 8118;
# 4) check "Also use this proxy for FTP and HTTPS".

# It is time to visit your favourite websites in Firefox.
# When you have enough :-), you can check some statistics:
$ firefox http://config.privoxy.org/show-status

# For example, you can see the percentage of blocked requests (Blocking Statistics),
# verify that there are no configuration warnings, or view action and filter files.
