#
# Fixes krb5-config to produce correct output on Solaris.
#
# The krb5-config generated in Userland gate produces some superfluous
# output, that can even break some consumers:
#
#   $ /usr/bin/krb5-config --libs krb5
#   -L/usr/lib/amd64 -R/usr/lib/amd64 -lc -z defs -lkrb5 -lk5crypto -lcom_err
#
# - default library path and runpath are not required
# - explicit paths are 64-bit specific
# - explicit linking with libc is not required for shared libraries
# - '-z defs' can break samba modules
#
# Note that we are adding -lc to LDFLAGS in component Makefile, because
# Solaris Studio 12.3 and newer no longer auto-adds it for shared objects.
# We need -lc for krb5 libs and plugins, but we shouldn't add -lc to 
# krb5-config output.
#
# Also note, that we are adding -z defs to LDFLAGS, to achieve complete
# dependency closure of krb5 plugins, so that they can be used with RTLD_GROUP.
# Using RTLD_GROUP is motivated by symbol clashes avoidance; using direct
# bindings is not possible, because we support plugins from outside of Solaris.
#
# The patch is not intended for upstream contribution.
# Patch source: in-house
