#
# This patch allows a successful dump of the kdb for full-resyncs when kadmind
# prompts for a master key, rather than gleaning one from a stash file.
#
# Original BugID is:
# 15401154 SUNBT6564718-SOLARIS_11 kdb5_util dump doesn't create a "dump ok"...
#
# Note: An MIT ticket has been submitted: #8042.  MIT will fix this differently
# than what is currently in this patch, but will not be fixed in the immediate
# future.  Not having this fix will cause noticeable regression with dependent
# customers.
# Patch source: in-house
