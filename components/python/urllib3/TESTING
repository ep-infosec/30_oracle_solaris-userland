Urllib3 is a dependency of requests, which does depend on quite narrow range of
versions. If you are updating urllib3, make sure that its version fits into
this range. Additionally to standard requires.txt and install_requires in
setup.py, there are also runtime checks (those can be found in __init__.py)
that can emit warnings if versions are not compatible.
