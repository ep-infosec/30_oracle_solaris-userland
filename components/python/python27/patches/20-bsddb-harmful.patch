Prior to 2.7.4, the bsddb module was a no-op, as it did not get built.
Starting with 2.7.4, the behavior is different, and it causes tests to
dump core.  So skip it.  The module is removed in Python 3, so this patch
is not being submitted upstream.

Note, that changes in setup.py are applied inside patch 02-setup.patch
(# raise db_found).
