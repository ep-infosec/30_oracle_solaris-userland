There is no easy way to do automated testing that produce consistent
results independent of what machine they are run on, but the following
can be done manually.

In one terminal window, start the iperf3 server with:

  $ cd .../components/iperf3/build/[amd64,sparcv9]/src
  $ ./iperf3 -s

In another terminal window, start the script to test various commands with:

  $ cd .../components/iperf3/build/[amd64,sparcv9]/
  $ ./test_commands.sh localhost
