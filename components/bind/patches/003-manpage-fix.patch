This patch is created by Oracle to addresses a couple of issues with
manual page references.  The ISC have been informed of these issues
and a future release of BIND should make this patch obsolete.

  1. "ndc" is no longer shipped now that rndc is established.
  2. "nsupdate" continues to be delivered in section 1, not 8.
  3. "mmencode" not provided with Solaris, use base64 for encoding secret.
