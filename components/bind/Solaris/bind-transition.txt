BIND version 9.16.29

Solaris provides the Extended Support  Version (ESV) of BIND.  Solaris
10,  and Solaris  11 (until  now) provided  BIND 9.11  ESV.  The  9.11
branch has  been declared end-of-life  as of  March 2022 and  has been
superseded by BIND 9.16 ESV.

BIND versions  are for  the most part  compatible.  Some  features may
however be deprecated.  Most configurable  features that are no longer
applicable are ignored.   The update from 9.11 to  9.16 is significant
and while no  major issues are expected it may  be necessary to modify
your configuration following this update of BIND.

Before rebooting into  the new Boot Environment (BE)  it is recomended
that you  shutdown BIND using the  rndc(8) command as below  to quiese
and flush any dynamic zone journal files.

      # rndc stop -p

Proceed once the named(8) process id, as displayed by rndc output, has
stopped running.  If rndc is not configured then continue to reboot as
normal. Note  that BIND  9.16 can  read BIND  9.11 journal  files, but
beware that BIND 9.11 can not read BIND 9.16 journal files.

Once booted  into the updated BE  check the SMF service  dns/server is
enabled   and   online.    Then    check   the   configuration   using
named-checkconf(8) command  and modify the  configuration accordingly,
do  this if  the  service is  offline  or online  as  it may  indicate
statements that are depricated.

      # named-checkconf -z

Significant work included in the 9.16 branch includes:

    1. The new Key and Signing Policy (KASP) feature provides
       simplified DNSSEC key and signing management using policies
       defined by the "dnssec-policy" statement. This tool is intended
       to significantly facilitate ongoing key and signing
       maintenance.

    2. The way that DNSSEC trust anchors are managed has been
       improved. Please note the updated CLI for this.

    3. DLV (Domain Look-aside Verification) has been deprecated since
       BIND 9.12. dlv.isc.org (the main service used by those
       previously relying on DLV, operated by ISC) was turned off
       in 2017. Support for DLV has now been removed from BIND 9
       completely. Removing this feature required a multi-year process
       of notification, working with partners, and gradual deprecation
       to avoid disruption in the DNS.

Removal of pkcs11 commands:

    The  following  commands and  associated  manual  pages have  been
    removed with immediate effect.

        /usr/sbin/pkcs11-destroy
        /usr/sbin/pkcs11-keygen
        /usr/sbin/pkcs11-list
        /usr/sbin/pkcs11-tokens
