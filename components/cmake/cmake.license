/*
  Independent implementation of MD5 (RFC 1321).

  This code implements the MD5 Algorithm defined in RFC 1321, whose
  text is available at
        http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt
  The code is derived from the text of the RFC, including the test suite
  (section A.5) but excluding the rest of Appendix A.  It does not include
  any code or documentation that is identified in the RFC as being
  copyrighted.

  The original and principal author of md5.c is L. Peter Deutsch
  <ghost@aladdin.com>.  Other authors are noted in the change history
  that follows (in reverse chronological order):

  2002-04-13 lpd Clarified derivation from RFC 1321; now handles byte order
        either statically or dynamically; added missing #include <string.h>
        in library.
  2002-03-11 lpd Corrected argument list for main(), and added int return
        type, in test program and T value program.
  2002-02-21 lpd Added missing #include <stdio.h> in test program.
  2000-07-03 lpd Patched to eliminate warnings about "constant is
        unsigned in ANSI C, signed in traditional"; made test program
        self-checking.
  1999-11-04 lpd Edited comments slightly for automatic TOC extraction.
  1999-10-18 lpd Fixed typo in header comment (ansi2knr rather than md5).
  1999-05-03 lpd Original version.

/* ==========================================================================
 * siphash.h - SipHash-2-4 in a single header file
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Derived by William Ahern from the reference implementation[1] published[2]
 * by Jean-Philippe Aumasson and Daniel J. Berstein.
 * Minimal changes by Sebastian Pipping and Victor Stinner on top, see below.
 * Licensed under the CC0 Public Domain Dedication license.
 *
 * 1. https://www.131002.net/siphash/siphash24.c
 * 2. https://www.131002.net/siphash/
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * HISTORY:
 *
 * 2020-10-03  (Sebastian Pipping)
 *   - Drop support for Visual Studio 9.0/2008 and earlier
 *
 * 2019-08-03  (Sebastian Pipping)
 *   - Mark part of sip24_valid as to be excluded from clang-format
 *   - Re-format code using clang-format 9
 *
 * 2018-07-08  (Anton Maklakov)
 *   - Add "fall through" markers for GCC's -Wimplicit-fallthrough
 *
 * 2017-11-03  (Sebastian Pipping)
 *   - Hide sip_tobin and sip_binof unless SIPHASH_TOBIN macro is defined
 *
 * 2017-07-25  (Vadim Zeitlin)
 *   - Fix use of SIPHASH_MAIN macro
 *
 * 2017-07-05  (Sebastian Pipping)
 *   - Use _SIP_ULL macro to not require a C++11 compiler if compiled as C++
 *   - Add const qualifiers at two places
 *   - Ensure <=80 characters line length (assuming tab width 4)
 *
 * 2017-06-23  (Victor Stinner)
 *   - Address Win64 compile warnings
 *
 * 2017-06-18  (Sebastian Pipping)
 *   - Clarify license note in the header
 *   - Address C89 issues:
 *     - Stop using inline keyword (and let compiler decide)
 *     - Replace _Bool by int
 *     - Turn macro siphash24 into a function
 *     - Address invalid conversion (void pointer) by explicit cast
 *   - Address lack of stdint.h for Visual Studio 2003 to 2008
 *   - Always expose sip24_valid (for self-tests)
 *
 * 2012-11-04 - Born.  (William Ahern)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * USAGE:
 *
 * SipHash-2-4 takes as input two 64-bit words as the key, some number of
 * message bytes, and outputs a 64-bit word as the message digest. This
 * implementation employs two data structures: a struct sipkey for
 * representing the key, and a struct siphash for representing the hash
 * state.
 *
 * For converting a 16-byte unsigned char array to a key, use either the
 * macro sip_keyof or the routine sip_tokey. The former instantiates a
 * compound literal key, while the latter requires a key object as a
 * parameter.
 *
 * 	unsigned char secret[16];
 * 	arc4random_buf(secret, sizeof secret);
 * 	struct sipkey *key = sip_keyof(secret);
 *
 * For hashing a message, use either the convenience macro siphash24 or the
 * routines sip24_init, sip24_update, and sip24_final.
 *
 * 	struct siphash state;
 * 	void *msg;
 * 	size_t len;
 * 	uint64_t hash;
 *
 * 	sip24_init(&state, key);
 * 	sip24_update(&state, msg, len);
 * 	hash = sip24_final(&state);
 *
 * or
 *
 * 	hash = siphash24(msg, len, key);
 *
 * To convert the 64-bit hash value to a canonical 8-byte little-endian
 * binary representation, use either the macro sip_binof or the routine
 * sip_tobin. The former instantiates and returns a compound literal array,
 * while the latter requires an array object as a parameter.
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * NOTES:
 *
 * o Neither sip_keyof, sip_binof, nor siphash24 will work with compilers
 *   lacking compound literal support. Instead, you must use the lower-level
 *   interfaces which take as parameters the temporary state objects.
 *
 * o Uppercase macros may evaluate parameters more than once. Lowercase
 *   macros should not exhibit any such side effects.
 * ==========================================================================

 * This differs from Colin Plumb's older public domain implementation in that
 * no exactly 32-bit integer data type is required (any 32-bit or wider
 * unsigned integer data type will do), there's no compile-time endianness
 * configuration, and the function prototypes match OpenSSL's.  No code from
 * Colin Plumb's implementation has been reused; this comment merely compares
 * the properties of the two independent implementations.
 *
 * The primary goals of this implementation are portability and ease of use.
 * It is meant to be fast, but not as fast as possible.  Some known
 * optimizations are not included to reduce source code size and avoid
 * compile-time configuration.

/* internal.h

   Internal definitions used by Expat.  This is not needed to compile
   client code.

   The following calling convention macros are defined for frequently
   called functions:

   FASTCALL    - Used for those internal functions that have a simple
                 body and a low number of arguments and local variables.

   PTRCALL     - Used for functions called though function pointers.

   PTRFASTCALL - Like PTRCALL, but for low number of arguments.

   inline      - Used for selected internal functions for which inlining
                 may improve performance on some platforms.

   Note: Use of these macros is based on judgement, not hard rules,
         and therefore subject to change.
