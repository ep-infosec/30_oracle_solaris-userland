# To run the test, you'll need to get pre-built installer of node.js for
# Solaris at nodejs.org since node.js is not delivered as part of Solaris
# yet. 
# Then go to qunit's source code root, such as 'qunit-1.23.1',
# run `npm install -g grunt-cli` to have a global grunt binary,
# and run `npm install` to get required node modules for additional grunt tasks.
# Finally run `grunt` to start running all the test tasks.
# However, phantomjs is not supported well in Solaris and there is not an intuitive
# patch for fixing it, therefore `npm install` fails when it tries to install
# phantomjs, and the test task can't be run.
# The phantomjs issue is discussed at:
#
# 	https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/10521
#
# These test tasks are passed successfully in a Mac OSX laptop. It'd be fine
# to use QUnit in the browser.
