The manpage and the HTML documentation is generated using Sphinx -
sphinx-doc.org. The last Oracle approved (TPNO 18268) version is 1.2.2.
The tool is not delivered as part of Solaris, so there's no way to generate
this automatically on build server(s), therefore whenever one is updating the
library, the documentation should be manually re-generated and the resulting
files added here.

The 'html' subdirectory is added as generated.

The jansson.3lib in 'man3lib' subdirectory needed to be manually modified after
generation so that Solaris nroff(1) is able to read it (GNU nroff is needed
otherwise).

Because we deliver the header files to /usr/include/jansson, it's necessary to
make sure the examples in the manpage and HTML documentation are correct when
updating the library.
