# This file specifies configure-line options to enable as many extensions as
# possible, and specifies their dependencies and anything else that's required.

# As of PHP 5.6.3:
# The following "extensions" are always statically compiled into PHP:
#    Core date pcre Reflection SPL standard
# The following are statically compiled unless --disable-all is used:
#    ctype dom fileinfo filter hash iconv json libxml PDO pdo_sqlite Phar posix
#    session SimpleXML sqlite3 tokenizer xml xmlreader xmlwriter
# The following is compiled as a shared extension unless --disable-all is used:
#    opcache

# The PHP build system allows building binaries for CLI, CGI, FPM, and one SAPI,
# at once.
# More than one SAPI (e.g. Apache and NSAPI) is not allowed. Since the only
# SAPI we deliver is Apache, only one build is necessary.

# CLI and CGI are enabled by default.

# because Solaris has installed them in /usr/include/foo/bar.h instead of
