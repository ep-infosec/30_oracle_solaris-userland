+.SH PACKAGE CONTENTS
+.sp
+.LP
+The \fBmemcached\fR package consists of the memcached server and
+man pages for the server. 
+.sp
+.LP
+Client libraries can be made available by installing other packages.
+.sp
+.LP
+The memcached server is based on the memcached open-source software
+available from http://www.danga.com/memcached/\&.
+.SH SECURITY
+.sp
+.LP
+When the memcached server is started, it listens for network requests
+on a TCP port and/or a UDP port. It is important for the security of the network
+that you protect this port, for example, by blocking access to this port in
+a firewall. 
+.sp
+.LP
+The default TCP port number to use is 11211. 
+.sp
+.LP
+You may use the \fB-p\fR option to set another TCP port number.
+There is no default UDP port number. You can use the \fB-U\fR option
+to set a UDP port number.
+.sp
+.LP
+If you are running memcached on a server with multiple network interfaces,
+you can restrict vulnerability by binding memcached to a single interface
+by using the \fB-l\fR option.
+.LP
+Caution - 
+.sp
+.RS 2
+Note that \fBmemcached\fR was designed for speed
+and not for security. There is no authentication of requests that go in to
+the memcached servers, and communication is not encrypted. The network that
+your memcached servers and clients run within should be safe-guarded against
+network attacks.
