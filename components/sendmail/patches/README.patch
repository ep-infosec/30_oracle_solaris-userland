-Complex sites will need more local configuration information, such as
-lists of UUCP hosts they speak with directly.  This can get a bit more
-tricky.  For an example of a "complex" site, see cf/ucbvax.mc.
-
-The SITECONFIG macro allows you to indirectly reference site-dependent
-configuration information stored in the siteconfig subdirectory.  For
-example, the line
-
-	SITECONFIG(`uucp.ucbvax', `ucbvax', `U')
-
-reads the file uucp.ucbvax for local connection information.  The
-second parameter is the local name (in this case just "ucbvax" since
-it is locally connected, and hence a UUCP hostname).  The third
-parameter is the name of both a macro to store the local name (in
-this case, {U}) and the name of the class (e.g., {U}) in which to store
-the host information read from the file.  Another SITECONFIG line reads
-
-	SITECONFIG(`uucp.ucbarpa', `ucbarpa.Berkeley.EDU', `W')
-
-This says that the file uucp.ucbarpa contains the list of UUCP sites
-connected to ucbarpa.Berkeley.EDU.  Class {W} will be used to
-store this list, and $W is defined to be ucbarpa.Berkeley.EDU, that
-is, the name of the relay to which the hosts listed in uucp.ucbarpa
-are connected.  [The machine ucbarpa is gone now, but this
-out-of-date configuration file has been left around to demonstrate
-how you might do this.]
-
-Note that the case of SITECONFIG with a third parameter of ``U'' is
-special; the second parameter is assumed to be the UUCP name of the
-local site, rather than the name of a remote site, and the UUCP name
-is entered into class {w} (the list of local hostnames) as $U.UUCP.
-
-The siteconfig file (e.g., siteconfig/uucp.ucbvax.m4) contains nothing
-more than a sequence of SITE macros describing connectivity.  For
-example:
-
-	SITE(`cnmat')
-	SITE(`sgi olympus')
-
-The second example demonstrates that you can use two names on the
-same line; these are usually aliases for the same host (or are at
-least in the same company).
-
-The macro LOCAL_UUCP can be used to add rules into the generated
-cf file at the place where MAILER(`uucp') inserts its rules.  This
-should only be used if really necessary.
