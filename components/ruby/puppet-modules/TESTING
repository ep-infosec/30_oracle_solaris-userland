Generic testing uses pre-built rspec tests with CI (travis-CI, AppVeyor)
based on github integration where coverage has been extended post modification.

While spec files can be installed by setting the facet.optional.test=true
tests cannot be run on Solaris without modifications to the environment
providing the required ruby gems.

See Puppet Documentation for an overview of testing with rspec
https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/docs/rspec_tutorial.md

Adhoc individual module testing may be performed by reviewing the Setup and
Usage portions of the README.md shipped with each module.

e.g. Testing install behavior with mysql
puppet apply -e "include '::mysql::server'"
