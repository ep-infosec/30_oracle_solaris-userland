## Dependencies:
Userland components:
The hplip, php and python components have build time dependencies on net-snmp, thus any 
uprev/interface change should be tested by creating a build machine with the updated 
net-snmp packages and then building the dependent component on that build setup.

ZFSSA:
We need to build and test net-snmp on a ZFSSA system out of ON with the new packages. 
The appliance package can be created by running a ON default build. 
Package location : $SRC/data/pkg/fish-i386-nondebug/<pkgname>.pkg, where $SRC is the workspace root.

Please refer the "Installing Appliance Media as an Update" section at
http://fgw.us.oracle.com/twiki-bin/view/FishDevelopers/BuildIka 
for more instructions on how to actually update the ZFSSA with the newly built package.
