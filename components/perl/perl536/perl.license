ABOUT PERL
==========

Perl is a general-purpose programming language originally developed for
text manipulation and now used for a wide range of tasks including
system administration, web development, network programming, GUI
development, and more.

The language is intended to be practical (easy to use, efficient,
complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal).  Its major
features are that it's easy to use, supports both procedural and
object-oriented (OO) programming, has powerful built-in support for text
processing, and has one of the world's most impressive collections of
third-party modules.

For an introduction to the language's features, see pod/perlintro.pod.

For a discussion of the important changes in this release, see
pod/perldelta.pod.

There are also many Perl books available, covering a wide variety of topics,
from various publishers.  See pod/perlbook.pod for more information.


INSTALLATION
============

If you're using a relatively modern operating system and want to
install this version of Perl locally, run the following commands:

  ./Configure -des -Dprefix=$HOME/localperl
  make test
  make install

This will configure and compile perl for your platform, run the regression
tests, and install perl in a subdirectory "localperl" of your home directory.

If you run into any trouble whatsoever or you need to install a customized
version of Perl, you should read the detailed instructions in the "INSTALL"
file that came with this distribution.  Additionally, there are a number of
"README" files with hints and tips about building and using Perl on a wide
variety of platforms, some more common than others.

Once you have Perl installed, a wealth of documentation is available to you
through the 'perldoc' tool.  To get started, run this command:

  perldoc perl


IF YOU RUN INTO TROUBLE
=======================

Perl is a large and complex system that's used for everything from
knitting to rocket science.  If you run into trouble, it's quite
likely that someone else has already solved the problem you're
facing. Once you've exhausted the documentation, please report bugs to us
at the GitHub issue tracker at https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues

While it was current when we made it available, Perl is constantly evolving
and there may be a more recent version that fixes bugs you've run into or
adds new features that you might find useful.

You can always find the latest version of perl on a CPAN (Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network) site near you at https://www.cpan.org/src/

If you want to submit a simple patch to the perl source, see the "SUPER
QUICK PATCH GUIDE" in pod/perlhack.pod.

Just a personal note:  I want you to know that I create nice things like this
because it pleases the Author of my story.  If this bothers you, then your
notion of Authorship needs some revision.  But you can use perl anyway. :-)

For those of you that choose to use the GNU General Public License,
my interpretation of the GNU General Public License is that no Perl
script falls under the terms of the GPL unless you explicitly put
said script under the terms of the GPL yourself.  Furthermore, any
object code linked with perl does not automatically fall under the
terms of the GPL, provided such object code only adds definitions
of subroutines and variables, and does not otherwise impair the
resulting interpreter from executing any standard Perl script.  I
consider linking in C subroutines in this manner to be the moral
equivalent of defining subroutines in the Perl language itself.  You
may sell such an object file as proprietary provided that you provide
or offer to provide the Perl source, as specified by the GNU General
Public License.  (This is merely an alternate way of specifying input
to the program.)  You may also sell a binary produced by the dumping of
a running Perl script that belongs to you, provided that you provide or
offer to provide the Perl source as specified by the GPL.  (The
fact that a Perl interpreter and your code are in the same binary file
is, in this case, a form of mere aggregation.)  This is my interpretation
of the GPL.  If you still have concerns or difficulties understanding
my intent, feel free to contact me.  Of course, the Artistic License
spells all this out for your protection, so you may prefer to use that.

=for apidoc isUTF8_CHAR

Evaluates to non-zero if the first few bytes of the string starting at C<s> and
looking no further than S<C<e - 1>> are well-formed UTF-8, as extended by Perl,
that represents some code point; otherwise it evaluates to 0.  If non-zero, the
value gives how many bytes starting at C<s> comprise the code point's
representation.  Any bytes remaining before C<e>, but beyond the ones needed to
form the first code point in C<s>, are not examined.

The code point can be any that will fit in an IV on this machine, using Perl's
extension to official UTF-8 to represent those higher than the Unicode maximum
of 0x10FFFF.  That means that this macro is used to efficiently decide if the
next few bytes in C<s> is legal UTF-8 for a single character.

Use C<L</isSTRICT_UTF8_CHAR>> to restrict the acceptable code points to those
defined by Unicode to be fully interchangeable across applications;
C<L</isC9_STRICT_UTF8_CHAR>> to use the L<Unicode Corrigendum
#9|http://www.unicode.org/versions/corrigendum9.html> definition of allowable
code points; and C<L</isUTF8_CHAR_flags>> for a more customized definition.

Use C<L</is_utf8_string>>, C<L</is_utf8_string_loc>>, and
C<L</is_utf8_string_loclen>> to check entire strings.

Note also that a UTF-8 "invariant" character (i.e. ASCII on non-EBCDIC
machines) is a valid UTF-8 character.

=cut

This uses an adaptation of the table and algorithm given in
https://bjoern.hoehrmann.de/utf-8/decoder/dfa/, which provides comprehensive
documentation of the original version.  A copyright notice for the original
version is given at the beginning of this file.  The Perl adapation is
documented at the definition of PL_extended_utf8_dfa_tab[].

/*
 * DFA for checking input is valid UTF-8 syntax.
 *
 * This uses adaptations of the table and algorithm given in
 * https://bjoern.hoehrmann.de/utf-8/decoder/dfa/, which provides comprehensive
 * documentation of the original version.  A copyright notice for the original
 * version is given at the beginning of this file.  The Perl adapations are
 * documented at the definition of PL_extended_utf8_dfa_tab[].
 *
 * This dfa is fast.  There are three exit conditions:
 *  1) a well-formed code point, acceptable to the table
 *  2) the beginning bytes of an incomplete character, whose completion might
 *     or might not be acceptable
 *  3) unacceptable to the table.  Some of the adaptations have certain,
 *     hopefully less likely to occur, legal inputs be unacceptable to the
 *     table, so these must be sorted out afterwards.
 *
 * This macro is a complete implementation of the code executing the DFA.  It
 * is passed the input sequence bounds and the table to use, and what to do
 * for each of the exit conditions.  There are three canned actions, likely to
 * be the ones you want:
 *      DFA_RETURN_SUCCESS_
 *      DFA_RETURN_FAILURE_
 *      DFA_GOTO_TEASE_APART_FF_
 *
 * You pass a parameter giving the action to take for each of the three
 * possible exit conditions:
 *
 * 'accept_action'  This is executed when the DFA accepts the input.
 *                  DFA_RETURN_SUCCESS_ is the most likely candidate.
 * 'reject_action'  This is executed when the DFA rejects the input.
 *                  DFA_RETURN_FAILURE_ is a candidate, or 'goto label' where
 *                  you have written code to distinguish the rejecting state
 *                  results.  Because it happens in several places, and
 *                  involves #ifdefs, the special action
 *                  DFA_GOTO_TEASE_APART_FF_ is what you want with
 *                  PL_extended_utf8_dfa_tab.  On platforms without
 *                  EXTRA_LONG_UTF8, there is no need to tease anything apart,
 *                  so this evaluates to DFA_RETURN_FAILURE_; otherwise you
 *                  need to have a label 'tease_apart_FF' that it will transfer
 *                  to.
 * 'incomplete_char_action'  This is executed when the DFA ran off the end
 *                  before accepting or rejecting the input.
 *                  DFA_RETURN_FAILURE_ is the likely action, but you could
 *                  have a 'goto', or NOOP.  In the latter case the DFA drops
 *                  off the end, and you place your code to handle this case
 *                  immediately after it.

 * This is a very fast storage allocator.  It allocates blocks of a small 
 * number of different sizes, and keeps free lists of each size.  Blocks that
 * don't exactly fit are passed up to the next larger size.  In this 
 * implementation, the available sizes are 2^n-4 (or 2^n-12) bytes long.
 * If PACK_MALLOC is defined, small blocks are 2^n bytes long.
 * This is designed for use in a program that uses vast quantities of memory,
 * but bombs when it runs out.
 * 
 * Modifications Copyright Ilya Zakharevich 1996-99.
 * 
 * Still very quick, but much more thrifty.  (Std config is 10% slower
 * than it was, and takes 67% of old heap size for typical usage.)
 *
 * Allocations of small blocks are now table-driven to many different
 * buckets.  Sizes of really big buckets are increased to accommodate
 * common size=power-of-2 blocks.  Running-out-of-memory is made into
 * an exception.  Deeply configurable and thread-safe.

 * A note on nomenclature:  The term UTF-8 is used loosely and inconsistently

 * platform UTF-8 is usually conflated with EBCDIC platform UTF-EBCDIC, because
 * outside some of the macros in this this file, the differences are hopefully
 * invisible at the semantic level.
 *
 * UTF-EBCDIC has an isomorphic translation named I8 (for "Intermediate eight")
 * which differs from UTF-8 only in a few details.  It is often useful to
 * translate UTF-EBCDIC into this form for processing.  In general, macros and
 * functions that are expecting their inputs to be either in I8 or UTF-8 are
 * named UTF_foo (without an '8'), to indicate this.
 *
 * Unfortunately there are inconsistencies.

=for apidoc isC9_STRICT_UTF8_CHAR

Evaluates to non-zero if the first few bytes of the string starting at C<s> and
looking no further than S<C<e - 1>> are well-formed UTF-8 that represents some
Unicode non-surrogate code point; otherwise it evaluates to 0.  If non-zero,
the value gives how many bytes starting at C<s> comprise the code point's
representation.  Any bytes remaining before C<e>, but beyond the ones needed to
form the first code point in C<s>, are not examined.

The largest acceptable code point is the Unicode maximum 0x10FFFF.  This
differs from C<L</isSTRICT_UTF8_CHAR>> only in that it accepts non-character
code points.  This corresponds to
L<Unicode Corrigendum #9|http://www.unicode.org/versions/corrigendum9.html>.
which said that non-character code points are merely discouraged rather than
completely forbidden in open interchange.  See
L<perlunicode/Noncharacter code points>.

Use C<L</isUTF8_CHAR>> to check for Perl's extended UTF-8; and
C<L</isUTF8_CHAR_flags>> for a more customized definition.

 *
 * Macros to implement UTF-EBCDIC as perl's internal encoding
 * Adapted from version 7.1 of Unicode Technical Report #16:
 *  http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr16
 *
 * To summarize, the way it works is:
 * To convert an EBCDIC code point to UTF-EBCDIC:
 *  1)	convert to Unicode.  No conversion is necesary for code points above
 *      255, as Unicode and EBCDIC are identical in this range.  For smaller
 *      code points, the conversion is done by lookup in the PL_e2a table (with
 *      inverse PL_a2e) in the generated file 'ebcdic_tables.h'.  The 'a'
 *      stands for ASCII platform, meaning 0-255 Unicode.  Use
 *      NATIVE_TO_LATIN1() and LATIN1_TO_NATIVE(), respectively to perform this
 *      lookup.  NATIVE_TO_UNI() and UNI_TO_NATIVE() are similarly used for any
 *      input, and know to avoid the lookup for inputs above 255.
 *  2)	convert that to a utf8-like string called I8 ('I' stands for
 *	intermediate) with variant characters occupying multiple bytes.  This
 *	step is similar to the utf8-creating step from Unicode, but the details
 *	are different.  This transformation is called UTF8-Mod.  There is a
 *	chart about the bit patterns in a comment later in this file.  But
 *	essentially here are the differences:
 *			    UTF8		I8
 *	invariant byte	    starts with 0	starts with 0 or 100
 *	continuation byte   starts with 10	starts with 101
 *	start byte	    same in both: if the code point requires N bytes,
 *			    then the leading N bits are 1, followed by a 0.  If
 *			    all 8 bits in the first byte are 1, the code point
 *			    will occupy 14 bytes (compared to 13 in Perl's
 *			    extended UTF-8).  This is incompatible with what
 *			    tr16 implies should be the representation of code
 *			    points 2**30 and above, but allows Perl to be able
 *			    to represent all code points that fit in a 64-bit
 *			    word in either our extended UTF-EBCDIC or UTF-8.
 *  3)	Use the algorithm in tr16 to convert each byte from step 2 into
 *	final UTF-EBCDIC.  This is done by table lookup from a table
 *	constructed from the algorithm, reproduced in ebcdic_tables.h as
 *	PL_utf2e, with its inverse being PL_e2utf.  They are constructed so that
 *	all EBCDIC invariants remain invariant, but no others do, and the first
 *	byte of a variant will always have its upper bit set.  But note that
 *	the upper bit of some invariants is also 1.  The table also is designed
 *	so that lexically comparing two UTF-EBCDIC-variant characters yields
 *	the Unicode code point order.  (To get native code point order, one has
 *	to convert the latin1-range characters to their native code point
 *	value.)  The macros NATIVE_UTF8_TO_I8() and I8_TO_NATIVE_UTF8() do the
 *	table lookups.
 *
 *  For example, the ordinal value of 'A' is 193 in EBCDIC, and also is 193 in
 *  UTF-EBCDIC.  Step 1) converts it to 65, Step 2 leaves it at 65, and Step 3
 *  converts it back to 193.  As an example of how a variant character works,
 *  take LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH DIAERESIS, which is typically 0xDF in
 *  EBCDIC.  Step 1 converts it to the Unicode value, 0xFF.  Step 2 converts
 *  that to two bytes = 11000111 10111111 = C7 BF, and Step 3 converts those to
 *  0x8B 0x73.
 *
 * If you're starting from Unicode, skip step 1.  For UTF-EBCDIC to straight
 * EBCDIC, reverse the steps.
 *
 * The EBCDIC invariants have been chosen to be those characters whose Unicode
 * equivalents have ordinal numbers less than 160, that is the same characters
 * that are expressible in ASCII, plus the C1 controls.  So there are 160
 * invariants instead of the 128 in UTF-8.
 *
 * The purpose of Step 3 is to make the encoding be invariant for the chosen
 * characters.  This messes up the convenient patterns found in step 2, so
 * generally, one has to undo step 3 into a temporary to use them, using the
 * macro NATIVE_TO_I8().  However, one "shadow", or parallel table,
 * PL_utf8skip, has been constructed that doesn't require undoing things.  It
 * is such that for each byte, it says how long the sequence is if that
* (UTF-EBCDIC) byte were to begin it
 *
 * There are actually 3 slightly different UTF-EBCDIC encodings in
 * ebcdic_tables.h, one for each of the code pages recognized by Perl.  That
 * means that there are actually three different sets of tables, one for each
 * code page.  (If Perl is compiled on platforms using another EBCDIC code
 * page, it may not compile, or Perl may silently mistake it for one of the
 * three.)
 *
 * Note that tr16 actually only specifies one version of UTF-EBCDIC, based on
 * the 1047 encoding, and which is supposed to be used for all code pages.
 * But this doesn't work.  To illustrate the problem, consider the '^' character.
 * On a 037 code page it is the single byte 176, whereas under 1047 UTF-EBCDIC
 * it is the single byte 95.  If Perl implemented tr16 exactly, it would mean
 * that changing a string containing '^' to UTF-EBCDIC would change that '^'
 * from 176 to 95 (and vice-versa), violating the rule that ASCII-range
 * characters are the same in UTF-8 or not.  Much code in Perl assumes this
 * rule.  See for example
 * http://grokbase.com/t/perl/mvs/025xf0yhmn/utf-ebcdic-for-posix-bc-malformed-utf-8-character
 * What Perl does is create a version of UTF-EBCDIC suited to each code page;
 * the one for the 1047 code page is identical to what's specified in tr16.
 * This complicates interchanging files between computers using different code
 * pages.  Best is to convert to I8 before sending them, as the I8
 * representation is the same no matter what the underlying code page is.
 *
 * Because of the way UTF-EBCDIC is constructed, the lowest 32 code points that
 * aren't equivalent to ASCII characters nor C1 controls form the set of
 * continuation bytes; the remaining 64 non-ASCII, non-control code points form
 * the potential start bytes, in order.  (However, the first 5 of these lead to
 * malformed overlongs, so there really are only 59 start bytes, and the first
 * three of the 59 are the start bytes for the Latin1 range.)  Hence the
 * UTF-EBCDIC for the smallest variant code point, 0x160, will have likely 0x41
 * as its continuation byte, provided 0x41 isn't an ASCII or C1 equivalent.
 * And its start byte will be the code point that is 37 (32+5) non-ASCII,
 * non-control code points past it.  (0 - 3F are controls, and 40 is SPACE,
 * leaving 41 as the first potentially available one.)  In contrast, on ASCII
 * platforms, the first 64 (not 32) non-ASCII code points are the continuation
 * bytes.  And the first 2 (not 5) potential start bytes form overlong
 * malformed sequences.
 *
 * EBCDIC characters above 0xFF are the same as Unicode in Perl's
 * implementation of all 3 encodings, so for those Step 1 is trivial.
 *
 * (Note that the entries for invariant characters are necessarily the same in
 * PL_e2a and PL_e2utf; likewise for their inverses.)
 *
 * UTF-EBCDIC strings are the same length or longer than UTF-8 representations
 * of the same string.  The maximum code point representable as 2 bytes in
 * UTF-EBCDIC is 0x3FFF, instead of 0x7FFF in UTF-8.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                     Version 1, February 1989

 Copyright (C) 1989 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                    51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users
at the mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  The
General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation's
software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.
You can use it for your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make
sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free
software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must tell them their rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The
"Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based
on the Program" means either the Program or any work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each
licensee is addressed as "you".

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License
along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of
transferring a copy.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph
1 above, provided that you also do the following:

    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
    you changed the files and the date of any change; and

    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that
    in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either
    with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all
    third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except
    that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all
    third parties, at your option).

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use
    in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General
    Public License.

    d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
    copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
    exchange for a fee.

Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its
derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
the other work under the scope of these terms.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of
it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge
    for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the
    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the
    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)

Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special
exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard
libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable
file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that
accompany that operating system.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License.
Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer
the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use
the Program under this License.  However, parties who have received
copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
remain in full compliance.

  5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based
on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,
and all its terms and conditions.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these
terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the
recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.

  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option)
    any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston MA  02110-1301 USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  program `Gnomovision' (a program to direct compilers to make passes
  at assemblers) written by James Hacker.
