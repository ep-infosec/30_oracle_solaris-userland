Without this patch many of perl tests fail. The reason is that perl sets the
locale via thread local newlocale(3C)/uselocale(3C), but reads the maximum
character size from global MB_CUR_MAX. At some point the MB_CUR_MAX value stops
to reflect the local thread settings. It will require deeper investigation to
find out why. For the time being I have replaced reading the global MB_CUR_MAX
with looking into thread local locale_t structure. This makes all tests but two
pass.

First failing test (ext/POSIX/t/mb.t) checks directly MB_CUR_MAX.
Second failing test (ext/re/t/re_funcs_u.t) does some regex testing with
  non-utf locale. I don't know why it fails and it does not seem directly
  related to the MB_CUR_MAX issue. If this test still fails once MB_CUR_MAX is
  fixed then it will need more attention.

Because this is rather workaround than real fix (which I suppose might be in
Solaris rather than in Perl) it is probably not suited for upstream.
