.TH libXaw 3lib "17 Dec 2018" "X Version 11"
.SH NAME
libXaw \- X Athena Widgets
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Xaw
is a widget set based on the X Toolkit Intrinsics (Xt) Library.  This
release of Oracle Solaris includes the latest version of the Xaw library. Since
the libXaw object model exposes structure sizes and layouts as part of the
ABI, binary compatibility is not always maintained between major releases
from the upstream X Window System projects.
.PP
.B libXaw.so.7
is the current release of libXaw, from the X11R7 release series.  Headers are 
provided for building applications against this version, and the 
.B libXaw
compilation link for -lXaw points to this version.
.PP
.BR libXaw.so.5 " and " libXaw.so.4
were previously provided for binary compatibility with applications built on 
older Solaris releases, but are no longer included in this release.
.B libXaw.so.5
was compatible with the X11R5 and X11R6 release series, and was the version of
libXaw that applications built on Solaris 2.3 through Solaris 10 were linked
with.
.B libXaw.so.4
was based on the X11R4 sources, and was linked to applications built on
Solaris 2.2 and prior releases of Solaris.
.PP
Applications using the Athena Widgets which need to run on current and
future releases of Solaris should be rebuilt against the current Xaw headers
and 
.B libXaw.so.7
library.

.SH NOTES
libXaw is provided for the benefit of existing software written to use
this library.  For writing new software, it is strongly recommended that a
modern toolkit, such as
.BR libgtk-3 "(3lib), "
is used instead, to provide required features such as full
internationalization and accessibility support, antialiased text,
modern rendering engines, and better integration with the desktop.
