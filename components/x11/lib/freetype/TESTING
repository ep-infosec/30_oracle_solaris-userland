Besides testing the normal desktop usage (X11, GNOME, Firefox, etc.) when
upgrading FreeType, you should also setup an x86 build machine for ON with
the new version installed and test the grub2 build works with the new version,
to avoid repeats of bugs like:
    Bug 20855151 - grub fails to build due to FreeType upgrade in s12_71
