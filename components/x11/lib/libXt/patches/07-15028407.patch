Oracle Bug 15028407 - SUNBT4344557 setting XmNpacking resource of XmRowColumn
   widget causes core dump

What happens is that when _XtAppInit is called it saves a backup of the
argv_in_out value passed into it.  The backup value is initially created with
space for the arguments, and one extra item so that the list may be NULL
terminated.

The argv_in_out list is then traversed and all values are copied before
finally NULL terminating the list.

At the end of the function, the argv_in_out value is in theory restored to
its original value, albeit with the contents in a new memory location(safe
from being freed by the shell or anyone else).  In this case, it has been
given a value that it didn't have in the first place.

When a NULL value is passed in to _XtAppInit, memory is allocated for one
item which is NULL.  The address of this memory is saved back to the
argv_in_out value instead of NULL.  Subsequent functions see a real value
instead of NULL and it is this value that is stored in the XtNargv resource
of the shell.  

When the value of XtNargv is retrieved it is not-null, but its value doesn't
make sense.

Need to evaluate for submission upstream.
