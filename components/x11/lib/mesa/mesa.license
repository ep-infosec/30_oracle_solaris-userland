 * Authors: Rickard E. (Rik) Faith <faith@valinux.com>
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This file contains a straightforward implementation of a fixed-sized
 * hash table using self-organizing linked lists [Knuth73, pp. 398-399] for
 * collision resolution.  There are two potentially interesting things
 * about this implementation:
 *
 * 1) The table is power-of-two sized.  Prime sized tables are more
 * traditional, but do not have a significant advantage over power-of-two
 * sized table, especially when double hashing is not used for collision
 * resolution.
 *
 * 2) The hash computation uses a table of random integers [Hanson97,
 * pp. 39-41].
 *
 * FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
 *
 * With a table size of 512, the current implementation is sufficient for a
 * few hundred keys.  Since this is well above the expected size of the
 * tables for which this implementation was designed, the implementation of
 * dynamic hash tables was postponed until the need arises.  A common (and
 * naive) approach to dynamic hash table implementation simply creates a
 * new hash table when necessary, rehashes all the data into the new table,
 * and destroys the old table.  The approach in [Larson88] is superior in
 * two ways: 1) only a portion of the table is expanded when needed,
 * distributing the expansion cost over several insertions, and 2) portions
 * of the table can be locked, enabling a scalable thread-safe
 * implementation.

 * @brief Arena memory manager
 *        The arena is convenient and fast for managing allocations for any of
 *        our allocations that are associated with operations and can all be freed
 *        once when their operation has completed. Allocations are cheap since
 *        most of the time its simply an increment of an offset. Also, no need to
 *        free individual allocations. All of the arena memory can be freed at once.

/* For |x| = |y| assume tan = 1 even if infinite (i.e. pretend momentarily

 *  "atan2(±∞, −∞) is ±3π/4
 *   atan2(±∞, +∞) is ±π/4"

 *  "atan2(±0, −0) is ±π
 *   atan2(±0, +0) is ±0"

/**
 * \file ralloc.h
 *
 * ralloc: a recursive memory allocator
 *
 * The ralloc memory allocator creates a hierarchy of allocated
 * objects. Every allocation is in reference to some parent, and
 * every allocated object can in turn be used as the parent of a
 * subsequent allocation. This allows for extremely convenient
 * discarding of an entire tree/sub-tree of allocations by calling
 * ralloc_free on any particular object to free it and all of its
 * children.
 *
 * The conceptual working of ralloc was directly inspired by Andrew
 * Tridgell's talloc, but ralloc is an independent implementation
 * released under the MIT license and tuned for Mesa.
 *
 * talloc is more sophisticated than ralloc in that it includes reference
 * counting and useful debugging features.  However, it is released under
 * a non-permissive open source license.
