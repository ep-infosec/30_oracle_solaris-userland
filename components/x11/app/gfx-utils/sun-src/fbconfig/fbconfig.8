.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBfbconfig\fR is the generic command line interface to query and/or to configure a frame buffer device. Depending on the command line options, \fBfbconfig\fR can invoke a device-specific configuration program which accepts additional options beyond those shown here.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported for all frame buffer devices:
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-defaults\fR\fR
.ad
.br
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Sets configuration options for the specified device to their default values. This does not affect the \fB-res\fR video mode setting. See the device-specific portions of the \fBDEFAULTS\fR section below.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-dev\fR \fIdevice-file\fR\fR
.ad
.br
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies the frame buffer device by either its full pathname or simple filename (for example, \fB/dev/fbs/efb0\fR or \fBefb0\fR). Pathnames of installed devices can be displayed using the \fB-list\fR option to \fBfbconfig\fR. If the \fB-dev\fR option is omitted, the default device, \fB/dev/fb\fR, is used.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-file\fR \fBmachine\fR | \fBsystem\fR | \fIconfig-path\fR\fR
.ad
.br
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specifies which \fBxorg.conf\fR file to open. If \fBmachine\fR is specified, the machine-specific \fB/etc/X11/xorg.conf\fR file is opened. If system is specified, the global \fB/usr/lib/X11/xorg.conf\fR file is opened. The absolute pathname of a configuration file can be used instead. If the specified file does not exist and is to be updated, it is created. The file system that contains the \fBxorg.conf\fR file must be writeable by someone with superuser-like privileges. This option has no effect unless other options are specified. The default is \fBmachine\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fB-help\fR\fR
.ad

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Displays the supported \fBfbconfig\fR command line options, along with a brief explanation of each. Also displays the \fB-help\fR text of the device-specific configuration program, if any. The frame buffer device can be specified using the \fB-dev\fR option, otherwise the default is used. Other \fBfbconfig\fR options are ignored. This is the default \fBfbconfig\fR option.
.RE

.sp

Set the video mode for the display device that is connected to the frame buffer device.
.sp
A list of video modes can be displayed using the \fB-res\fR  \fB?\fR option.
.sp
The basic format of a video-mode is \fIwidth\fRx\fIheight\fRx\fIrate\fR, where:
.sp

\fIwidth\fR is the screen width in pixels.

\fIheight\fR is the screen height in pixels.

.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu

\fIrate\fR is the vertical frequency of the screen refresh.

.RE
A video-mode argument might have an \fB@\fR (at sign) instead of \fBx\fR preceding the refresh rate. For instance, \fB1280x1024x76\fR and \fB1280x1024@76\fR are equivalent.
.sp
A video-mode name might carry additional information, as with \fBSUNW_STD_1280x1024x76\fR.
.sp
The \fB-res\fR argument, \fBauto\fR, represents the video mode that is currently programmed into the device. The argument, \fBnone\fR, is a synonym for \fBauto\fR.
.sp
Note that some video modes might be inappropriate for certain frame buffer devices and/or display devices.

The \fB-res\fR option accepts suboption keywords following the video-mode specification.

The \fBnocheck\fR suboption causes the video-mode argument to be accepted, regardless of whether it is supported by the currently attached monitor, whether it is known within the current configuration, and so forth. Note that using an unchecked, inappropriate video mode can leave the system without usable video output. This suboption is useful if a different monitor is to be connected to the frame buffer device.

If \fBfalse\fR, a nonlinear visual that satisfies the other default visual selection options, such as the default depth and default class, is chosen as the default visual.

This option selects the default X visual. Some devices might provide an 8-bit PseudoColor visual whose pixels are disjoint from the rest of the visuals. This is called the overlay visual. Windows created in this visual does not damage windows created in other visuals. The converse, however, is not true: Windows created in other visuals damage overlay windows.
.sp
If the value of this option is \fBtrue\fR, the overlay visual is the default visual. The default depth is 8-bit and the default class is PseudoColor. If \fBfalse\fR, the non-overlay visual that satisfies the other default visual selection options, such as the default depth and the default class, is chosen as the default visual.
.sp

If the value of this option is \fBtrue\fR, the overlay visual used as the default is a transparent overlay visual. A visual with transparency supports a colormap with 255 colors and one transparent pixel. The default depth is 8-bit and the default class is PseudoColor.

.RS 4n
Loads the gamma correction table from the file specified by \fIgamma-correction-file\fR. This text file specifies the gamma correction values for the R, G, and B channels. Three consecutive values form an RGB triplet. For a \fBkfb\fR device, there must be exactly 256 RGB triplets. A value might be represented in hexadecimal, decimal, or octal format (for example, \fB0x3FF\fR, \fB1023\fR, or \fB01777\fR, respectively). Values are separated by one or more whitespace or new line characters. Comments begin with a hash sign character (\fB#\fR) and end at the end of the line.
.sp
You can load the gamma correction table with this option while the window system is running. The new gamma correction affects all the windows being displayed using the linear visuals. When gamma correction is done using a user-specified table, the gamma correction value (\fB-g\fR) is undefined. By default, the window system assumes a gamma correction value of \fB2.22\fR and loads the gamma table it creates corresponding to this value.

.SH DEFAULTS
.sp
.LP
Certain options have implied default arguments. The default argument is used when the option is not present on the \fBfbconf_xorg\fR command line. For instance, a default argument for \fB-dev\fR is \fB/dev/fb\fR.
.sp
.LP
Options that set configuration state do not have implied defaults. The \fB-res\fR option is one example. If a configuration option is omitted from the \fBfbconf_xorg\fR command line, the corresponding \fBxorg.conf\fR configuration setting remains unchanged. The exception is that if configuration options are mutually exclusive, setting one automatically unsets each of the others. An example is \fB-deflinear\fR, \fB-defoverlay\fR, and \fB-deftransparent\fR.
.sp
.LP
If a configuration setting is not present in the configuration file when the window system is run, a default value is used. For instance, the default state associated with \fB-res\fR is \fBauto\fR. A setting might not be present in the file, or the file itself might not exist, until \fBfbconf_xorg\fR has been invoked with the corresponding command line option.
