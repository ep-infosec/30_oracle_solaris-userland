  This frees resources that should never be retained
             *  no matter what the close down mode is.  Actually we
             *  could do this unconditionally, but it's probably
             *  better not to traverse all the client's resources
             *  twice (once here, once a few lines down in
             *  FreeClientResources) in the common case of
             *  really_close_down == TRUE.
              We're about to start speaking X protocol back to the client by
     * sending the connection setup info.  This means the authorization
     * step is complete, and we can count the client as an
     * authorized one.
          * We cannot register the Screen PRIVATE_CURSOR key if cursors are already
     * created, because dix/privates.c does not have relocation code for
     * PRIVATE_CURSOR. Once this is fixed the if() can be removed and we can
     * register the Screen PRIVATE_CURSOR key unconditionally.

 Move back results of software rendering on system memory copy of mixed driver
     * pixmap (see exaPrepareAccessReg_mixed).
     *
     * Defer moving the destination back into the driver pixmap, to try and save
     * overhead on multiple subsequent software fallbacks.
      With mixed pixmaps, if we fail to get direct access to the driver pixmap, we
 use the DownloadFromScreen hook to retrieve contents to a copy in system
 memory, perform software rendering on that and move back the results with the
 UploadToScreen hook (see exaDamageReport_mixed).

 integer for use as an array index.  If the signed char is negative,
 we want to instead treat it as an 8-bit unsigned char, hence the
 double cast.
 

 Enter a start condition.  This macro really ought to take a parameter,
 but we do it the disgusting crufty way forced on us by the ()-less
 definition of BEGIN.
 

 Translate the current start state into a value that can be later handed
 to BEGIN to return to the state.  The YYSTATE alias is for lex
 compatibility.
 

 Action number for EOF rule of a given start state. 

 Special action meaning "start processing a new file".

 Linux version of keymapping setup. The kernel (since 0.99.14) has support
 for fully remapping the keyboard, but there are some differences between
 the Linux map and the SVR4 map (esp. in the extended keycodes). We also
 remove the restriction on what keycodes can be remapped.

 This file contains macros for the PCI Vendor and Device IDs for video
 cards plus a few other things that are needed in drivers or elsewhere.
 This information is used in several ways:
   1. It is used by drivers and/or other code.
   2. It is used by the pciid2c.pl script to determine what vendor data to
      include in the pcidata module that the X server loads.
   3. A side-effect of 2. affects how config-generation works for
      otherwise "unknown" cards.

 Don't add entries here for vendors that don't make video cards,
 or for non-video devices unless they're needed by a driver or elsewhere.
 A comprehensive set of PCI vendor, device and subsystem data is
 auto-generated from the ../etc/pci.ids file using the pciids2c.pl script,
 and is used in scanpci utility.  Don't modify the pci.ids file.  If
 new/corrected entries are required, add them to ../etc/extrapci.ids.

 This file contains the VidMode functions required by the extension.
 These have been added to avoid the need for the higher level extension
 code to access the private XFree86 data structures directly. Wherever
 possible this code uses the functions in xf86Mode.c to do the work,
 so that two version of code that do similar things don't have to be
 maintained.

 A note on terminology.  DDC1 is the original dumb serial protocol, and
 can only do up to 128 bytes of EDID.  DDC2 is I2C-encapsulated and
 introduces extension blocks.  EDID is the old display identification

*
 Schedule a buffer swap

 This callback is used to support glXSwapBuffers and the OML_sync_control
 extension (see it for a description of the params).

 Drivers should queue an event for the frame count that satisfies the
 parameters passed in.  If the event is in the future (i.e. the conditions
 aren't currently satisfied), the server may block the client at the next
 GLX request using DRI2WaitSwap. When the event arrives, drivers should call
 \c DRI2SwapComplete, which will handle waking the client and returning
 the appropriate data.

 The DDX is responsible for doing a flip, exchange, or blit of the swap
 when the corresponding event arrives.  The \c DRI2CanFlip and
 \c DRI2CanExchange functions can be used as helpers for this purpose.

 \param client client pointer (used for block/unblock)
 \param pDraw drawable whose count we want
 \param pDestBuffer current front buffer
 \param pSrcBuffer current back buffer
 \param target_msc frame count to wait for
 \param divisor divisor for condition equation
 \param remainder remainder for division equation
 \param func function to call when the swap completes
 \param data data for the callback \p func.
 *
 Schedule a frame count related wait

 This callback is used to support the SGI_video_sync and OML_sync_control
 extensions.  See those specifications for details on how to handle
 the divisor and remainder parameters.

 Drivers should queue an event for the frame count that satisfies the
 parameters passed in.  If the event is in the future (i.e. the conditions
 aren't currently satisfied), the driver should block the client using
 \c DRI2BlockClient.  When the event arrives, drivers should call
 \c DRI2WaitMSCComplete, which will handle waking the client and returning

 The reason for having this function in a file of its own is
 so that ../utils/cvt/cvt can link to it, and that xf86CVTMode
 code is shared directly.
 
 Generate a CVT standard mode from HDisplay, VDisplay and VRefresh.

 These calculations are stolen from the CVT calculation spreadsheet written
 by Graham Loveridge. He seems to be claiming no copyright and there seems to
 be no license attached to this. He apparently just wants to see his name
 mentioned.

 This file can be found at http://www.vesa.org/Public/CVT/CVTd6r1.xls

 Comments and structure corresponds to the comments and structure of the xls.
 This should ease importing of future changes to the standard (not very
 likely though).

 About margins; i'm sure that they are to be the bit between HDisplay and
 HBlankStart, HBlankEnd and HTotal, VDisplay and VBlankStart, VBlankEnd and
 VTotal, where the overscan colour is shown. FB seems to call _all_ blanking
 outside sync "margin" for some reason. Since we prefer seeing proper
 blanking instead of the overscan colour, and since the Crtc* values will
 probably get altered after us, we will disable margins altogether. With
 these calculations, Margins will plainly expand H/VDisplay, and we don't
 want that. -- libv

 DarwinAdjustScreenOrigins
  Shift all screens so the X11 (0, 0) coordinate is at the top
  left of the global screen coordinates.

  Screens can be arranged so the top left isn't on any screen, so
  instead use the top left of the leftmost screen as (0,0). This
  may mean some screen space is in -y, but it's better that (0,0)
  be onscreen, or else default xterms disappear. It's better that
  -y be used than -x, because when popup menus are forced
  "onscreen" by dumb window managers like twm, they'll shift the
  menus down instead of left, which still looks funny but is an
  easier target to hit.

xorg-server-1.20.3/hw/xquartz/keysym2ucs.c:

 This module converts keysym values into the corresponding ISO 10646
 (UCS, Unicode) values.

 The array keysymtab[] contains pairs of X11 keysym values for graphical
 characters and the corresponding Unicode value. The function
 keysym2ucs() maps a keysym onto a Unicode value using a binary search,
 therefore keysymtab[] must remain SORTED by keysym value.

 The keysym -> UTF-8 conversion will hopefully one day be provided
 by Xlib via XmbLookupString() and should ideally not have to be
 done in X applications. But we are not there yet.

 We allow to represent any UCS character in the range U-00000000 to
 U-00FFFFFF by a keysym value in the range 0x01000000 to 0x01ffffff.
 This admittedly does not cover the entire 31-bit space of UCS, but
 it does cover all of the characters up to U-10FFFF, which can be
 represented by UTF-16, and more, and it is very unlikely that higher
 UCS codes will ever be assigned by ISO. So to get Unicode character
 U+ABCD you can directly use keysym 0x0100abcd.

 NOTE: The comments in the table below contain the actual character
 encoded in UTF-8, so for viewing and editing best use an editor in
 UTF-8 mode.

 The reason for having this function in a file of its own is
 so that ../utils/cvt/cvt can link to it, and that xf86CVTMode
 code is shared directly.
 
 Generate a CVT standard mode from HDisplay, VDisplay and VRefresh.

 These calculations are stolen from the CVT calculation spreadsheet written
 by Graham Loveridge. He seems to be claiming no copyright and there seems to
 be no license attached to this. He apparently just wants to see his name
 mentioned.

 This file can be found at http://www.vesa.org/Public/CVT/CVTd6r1.xls

 Comments and structure corresponds to the comments and structure of the xls.
 This should ease importing of future changes to the standard (not very
 likely though).

 About margins; i'm sure that they are to be the bit between HDisplay and
 HBlankStart, HBlankEnd and HTotal, VDisplay and VBlankStart, VBlankEnd and
 VTotal, where the overscan colour is shown. FB seems to call _all_ blanking
 outside sync "margin" for some reason. Since we prefer seeing proper
 blanking instead of the overscan colour, and since the Crtc* values will
 probably get altered after us, we will disable margins altogether. With
 these calculations, Margins will plainly expand H/VDisplay, and we don't
 want that. -- libv

 Create a new, unique, anonymous file of the given size, and
 return the file descriptor for it. The file descriptor is set
 CLOEXEC. The file is immediately suitable for mmap()'ing
 the given size at offset zero.

 The file should not have a permanent backing store like a disk,
 but may have if XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is not properly implemented in OS.

 The file name is deleted from the file system.

 The file is suitable for buffer sharing between processes by
 transmitting the file descriptor over Unix sockets using the
 SCM_RIGHTS methods.

 If the C library implements posix_fallocate(), it is used to
 guarantee that disk space is available for the file at the
 given size. If disk space is insufficent, errno is set to ENOSPC.
 If posix_fallocate() is not supported, program may receive
 SIGBUS on accessing mmap()'ed file contents instead.

 All of our keys generate up and down transition notifications,
 so all of our keys can be used as modifiers.

 An example of a modifier is mapping the A key to the Control key.
 A has to be a legal modifier.  I think.

  TODO:
  - hook up remaining unimplemented extensions
  - research what guarantees glXWaitX, glXWaitGL are supposed to offer, and implement then
    using GdiFlush and/or glFinish
  - pbuffer clobbering: we don't get async notification, but can we arrange to emit the
    event when we notice it's been clobbered? at the very least, check if it's been clobbered
    before using it?
  - XGetImage() doesn't work on pixmaps; need to do more work to make the format and location
    of the native pixmap compatible
  - implement GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap in terms of WGL_ARB_render_texture
    (not quite straightforward as we will have to create a pbuffer and copy the pixmap texture
     into it)



  Assumptions:
  - the __GLXConfig * we get handed back ones we are made (so we can extend the structure
    with privates) and never get created inside the GLX core



  MSDN clarifications:

  It says SetPixelFormat()'s PIXELFORMATDESCRIPTOR pointer argument has no effect
  except on metafiles, this seems to mean that as it's ok to supply NULL if the DC
  is not for a metafile

  wglMakeCurrent ignores the hdc if hglrc is NULL, so wglMakeCurrent(NULL, NULL)
  is used to make no context current


 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 Lazy update context implementation

 WGL contexts are created for a specific HDC, so we cannot create the WGL
 context in glxWinCreateContext(), we must defer creation until the context
 is actually used on a specifc drawable which is connected to a native window,
 pbuffer or DIB

 The WGL context may be used on other, compatible HDCs, so we don't need to
 recreate it for every new native window

 XXX: I wonder why we can't create the WGL context on the screen HDC ?
 Basically we assume all HDCs are compatible at the moment: if they are not
 we are in a muddle, there was some code in the old implementation to attempt
 to transparently migrate a context to a new DC by copying state and sharing
 lists with the old one...
 
         * We enable GLX_SGI_make_current_read unconditionally, but the
         * renderer might not support it. It's fairly rare to use this
         * feature so just error out if it can't work.

 Defines the interface between the libglvnd server module and a vendor
 library.

 Each screen may have one vendor library assigned to it. The GLVND module
 will examine each GLX request to determine which screen it goes to, and then
 it will forward that request to whichever vendor is assigned to that screen.

 Each vendor library is represented by an opaque __GLXServerVendor handle.
 Display drivers are responsible for creating handles for its GLX
 implementations, and assigning those handles to each screen.

 The GLVND module keeps a list of callbacks, which are called from
 InitExtensions. Drivers should use that callback to assign a vendor
 handle to whichever screens they support.

 Additional notes about dispatching:
 - If a request has one or more GLXContextTag values, then the dispatch stub
   must ensure that all of the tags belong to the vendor that it forwards the
   request to. Otherwise, if a vendor library tries to look up the private
   data for the tag, it could get the data from another vendor and crash.
 - Following from the last point, if a request takes a GLXContextTag value,
   then the dispatch stub should use the tag to select a vendor. If the
   request takes two or more tags, then the vendor must ensure that they all
   map to the same vendor.

 MIOPQSTIPDRAWABLE -- use pbits as an opaque stipple for pDraw.
 Drawing through the clip mask we SetSpans() the bits into a
 bitmap and stipple those bits onto the destination drawable by doing a
 PolyFillRect over the whole drawable,
 then we invert the bitmap by copying it onto itself with an alu of
 GXinvert, invert the foreground/background colors of the gc, and draw
 the background bits.
 Note how the clipped out bits of the bitmap are always the background
 color so that the stipple never causes FillRect to draw them.

with the sample server.

    get a scratch GC.
    in the scratch GC set alu = GXcopy, fg = 1, bg = 0
    allocate a bitmap big enough to hold the largest glyph in the font
    validate the scratch gc with the bitmap
    for each glyph
	carefully put the bits of the glyph in a buffer,
	    padded to the server pixmap scanline padding rules
	fake a call to PutImage from the buffer into the bitmap
	use the bitmap in a call to PushPixels

 This file contains functionality for identifying clients by various
 means. The primary purpose of identification is to simply aid in
 finding out which clients are using X server and how they are using
 it. For example, it's often necessary to monitor what requests
 clients are executing (to spot bad behaviour) and how they are
 allocating resources in X server (to spot excessive resource
 usage).

 This framework automatically allocates information, that can be
 used for client identification, when a client connects to the
 server. The information is freed when the client disconnects. The
 allocated information is just a collection of various IDs, such as
 PID and process name for local clients, that are likely to be
 useful in analyzing X server usage.

 Users of the framework can query ID information about clients at
 any time. To avoid repeated polling of IDs the users can also
 subscribe for notifications about the availability of ID
 information. IDs have been allocated before ClientStateCallback is
 called with ClientStateInitial state. Similarly the IDs will be
 released after ClientStateCallback is called with ClientStateGone
 state.

 Animated cursors for X.  Not specific to Render in any way, but

 Implemented as a simple layer over the core cursor code; it
 creates composite cursors out of a set of static cursors and
 delta times between each image.

             * if there is no client clip, we can get by with just keeping the
             * pointer we got, and remembering whether or not should destroy
             * (or maybe re-use) it later.  this way, we avoid unnecessary
             * copying of regions.  (this wins especially if many clients clip
             * by children and have no client clip.)

 This function sends out two kinds of notification:
   - Core mapping notify events sent to clients for whom kbd is the
     current core ('picked') keyboard _and_ have not explicitly
     selected for XKB mapping notify events;
   - Xi mapping events, sent unconditionally to all clients who have
     explicitly selected for them (including those who have explicitly
     selected for XKB mapping notify events!).
