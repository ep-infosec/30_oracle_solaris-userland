.TH application/x11/x11-server 8S "26 Nov 2018" "Oracle Solaris" "SMF Services"
.SH NAME
svc:/application/x11/x11-server \- X Window System display service
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B svc:/application/x11/x11-server
is the service identifier for configuring the X Window System display server
with the service management facility, \fBsmf\fR(5).
In this release of Oracle Solaris, \fB/usr/bin/X\fR is a link to the
\fBXserver\fR program which starts the appropriate X server based on
properties set for this service.
.SH "STARTING THE SERVER"
On Oracle Solaris 11, the X server is usually started from the GNOME
Display Manager program \fBgdm\fP(8). This role may also be performed
by the X Display Manager program \fBxdm\fP(1), or another display manager.
Besides starting the X server, these display managers also provide a
login dialog for users and start their desktop environment.
.PP
While the configuration of the X server may be managed via SMF, the
\fBsvcs\fR(8) command will not list any instances of the x11-server
service in a normal configuration, as the X server will be started
via a display manager instead of by the SMF system directly, or on
demand via a program such as \fBstartx\fP(1).
.PP
An SMF instance may be created when necessary to have the system automatically
start an X server without a display manager or other control program.  An
example of this is provided in the EXAMPLES section below.
.SH SMF PROPERTIES
.PP
Use \fBsvccfg\fR(8) to make configuration changes and to view configuration
information for the \fBsvc:/application/x11/x11-server\fP service\&.
.PP
\fB/usr/bin/Xserver\fP will look for configuration options in the
instances in this order, stopping at the first match for the given
property:
.TP
1.
\fB:display\fP\fIN\fP (where \fIN\fP is the display number of the X server,
i.e. \fB:display0\fP for :0)
.TP
2.
Any class names provided via the \fB-c\fP options to
\fB/usr/bin/Xserver\fP.  Multiple \fB-c\fP options may be provided, if so,
they are searched in the order found on the command line.
.TP
3.
If any XDMCP options are provided to open a remote display connection,
\fB:remote\fP, otherwise \fB:local\fP
.TP
4.
The default properties for the service
.PP
Class names may be any valid FMRI instance name.   Sun reserves all class names
beginning with lowercase letters for its own use - customers wishing to create
their own class names may use names beginning with an uppercase letter.

.PP
These properties may be set in any instance of x11-server or for the service
itself:
.TP
.B options/server
(Type astring) The absolute path to the X server binary to run, currently
must be one of:
.sp
.nf
\fB/usr/bin/Xorg\fP
\fB/usr/bin/Xvfb\fP
\fB/usr/bin/Xvnc\fP
.fi
.TP
.B options/config_file
(Type string) Setting this to a filename causes this file to be used as the
configuration file for the X server.   Currently this property is only
available when used with the Xorg server.  The value of this property must
be a relative path from one of the directories in the Xorg config file
search path, and not an absolute path.
.TP
.B options/tcp_listen
(Type boolean) Setting this to true enables listening for incoming TCP/IP
connections.  The default is false.  Please note that the /etc/gdm/custom.conf
setting of DisallowTCP takes precedence over this setting when the X server 
is started with gdm.
.TP
.B options/default_depth
(Type int) Sets the depth of the default visual of the X server started.
.TP
.B options/server_args
(Type astring) Sets additional arguments to pass to the X server started.  Care
must be used when using options specific to a particular X server as then it
may cause failure to start the X server if the server to be started is later
changed to one that does not support those options.
.TP
.B options/display_0_on_console
(Type boolean) Setting this to true starts the X server with a DISPLAY ":0.0"
on "/dev/console" rather than the first available "/dev/vt/#", see vt(4i),
this preserves backward compatibility with programs such as "xterm -C"
that expect have access to "/dev/console".  X servers with any other DISPLAY
are not affected. The default is false.
.TP
.B options/vncplatform_override
(Type boolean) Setting this to true starts the Xorg server instead of the
Xvnc server for platforms that have ILOM VNC support.
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS "Example: Allow remote access"
.PP
The following command allows access from remote clients.
.sp
.nf
svccfg -s svc:/application/x11/x11-server \\
    setprop options/tcp_listen = true
.fi
.sp
Restart the Xserver by either logging out and logging back in, or manually
if the Xserver was started from the command line.
.sp
.SS "Example: Use of VESA driver"
.PP
The following command overrides the default Xorg driver selection to use the
/usr/lib/X11/xorg.conf.vesa configuration file to select the "vesa" driver.
.sp
.nf
svccfg -s svc:/application/x11/x11-server \\
    setprop options/config_file=xorg.conf.vesa
.fi
.SS "Example: Enabling the XINERAMA extension"
.PP
The following command enables the XINERAMA extension.
.sp
.nf
svccfg -s svc:/application/x11/x11-server \\
    setprop options/server_args = +xinerama
.fi
