If you make a change you need to install it to the machine before running
'gmake test'.

After installing the package you can also manually try running a test like
$ java -cp /usr/share/lib/java/junit.jar:/usr/share/doc/junit/samples/org \
       junit/samples/money/MoneyTest

If you need to create your own test you can take the "Getting Started" example
from https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Getting-started. But I had to
compile the tests slightly differently

javac -cp .:/usr/share/lib/java/junit-4.11.jar CalculatorTest.java

and run the test similarly

java -cp .:/usr/share/lib/java/junit-4.11.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore CalculatorTest
