Squid comes with a set of tests, so don't forget to run "gmake test"
and make sure that the output matches the master test results.

These squid tests use cppunit. Currently this requires a version of cppunit
installed that have been built with the GNU version 5.3 compilers.

Install on lab machine:

vm install <path to your WS-dir> squid

 or in case of troubles:

pkg change-facet --no-refresh version-lock.web/proxy/squid=False
pkg install -g <your ws>/$(uname -p)/repo pkg://nightly/web/proxy/squid

To test manually follow along in the book
Squid Proxy Server 3.1 Beginner's Guide Page 34

Add the following line to the top of /etc/squid/squid.conf:

cache_dir ufs /var/squid/cache/ 500 16 256

Start squid:

   svcadm enable squid

Now you can check if squid listen on localhost:

   curl -x localhost:3128 -v -o ipkg.html -L 'http://ipkg.cz.oracle.com/solaris11/support/'

then you should see something like a:
...
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 3128 (#0)
> GET http://ipkg.cz.oracle.com/solaris11/support/ HTTP/1.1
> Host: ipkg.cz.oracle.com
> User-Agent: curl/7.64.0-DEV
> Accept: */*
> Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive
...

Also ipkg.html will contain the page.

Now you can check failure test:

   curl -x localhost:789 -v -o fail.html -L 'http://ipkg.cz.oracle.com/solaris11/support/'

then you should see something like a:
...
*   Trying ::1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Failed to set TCP_KEEPALIVE on fd 4
* Expire in 149999 ms for 3 (transfer 0x8eec298e70)
