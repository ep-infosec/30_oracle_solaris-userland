# This file is formated in a very specific way to reduce the risk
# of accidental mismerging on updates.  DO NOT change the formating of
# individual entries and DO follow the style for new entries.
#
# It uses \ continuation to break up what is basically one big long line
# for each profile.
#
# The fields are : separated.  The first three fields (and the first three
# colons) should all be on one line that is NOT indented).
# Each comma separated auths or profile sub entry should be on its own line.
# and each semi-colon separated sub field should be on its own line too.
