This suite also runs fuzz tests, which means it pumps out a lot of
random warnings and scary messages.  Ignore them, except to mentally note
that the fuzz testing did occur.  The transform-results script gets rid
of everything that varies from test to test or architecture to architecture,
and decides PASS/FAIL based upon the results of the transform.

NOTE: cleanup does not restore the previous Kerberos setup.


To run testsuite:

PREP:  gmake test_tarball in components/cyrus-sasl

On a lab machine that has a static ip address, accessible by nslookup:

    --  make sure you are ready and willing to destroy your kerberos setup
    --  set publisher to install the version of libsasl2 to test, and 
        install libsasl2.

        The test setup tries to install the optional sasl plugins, which are
	each separate packages, so each one has its own .p5m file.  To 
	find existing ones, which will need their facets unlocked:

	    pkg list -a /system/library/security/sasl/*

	If the lab system has old versions  of any optional sasl plugins,
	either uninstall them or disable solaris publishers, so that you 
	only get the ones from your own publisher.  

	Setup will not try to install libsasl-links, it's not a plugin.


    --      cd /var/tmp
	    gtar zxf sasltest.tgz
	    cd sasltest

As root:
    If this is not the first test run, run ./cleanup or the test will not 
    run.

    ./run_testsuite
    [ answer y to "Existing KDC config will be destroyed, okay to proceed?" ]

    [gather results]
    If doing another run:  ./cleanup  



TODO: 
	debug GSS-SPNEGO mechanism and/or test

	See if there is a way to run the test without nslookup-able address
	(the setup was inherited from kerberos tests and may or may not
	be overly strict)
