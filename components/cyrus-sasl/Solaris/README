Configuration files for applications using libsasl and other sasl features
should go in /etc/sasl2 or else in configuration directories expected by
the specific application.

IMPORTANT:  sasl will try to use everything it finds in /usr/lib/sasl2 unless
precluded by configuration files.  Since much more is provided than any
one application configuration should use, it is important to actively
choose the contents of the auxprop_plugin and mech_list, and possibly the 
canon_user_plugin, so that only the desired subset is configured for a
specific application.

These lines show all the default possibilities:
#auxprop_plugin: sasldb
#canon_user_plugin: INTERNAL
#mech_list:  LOGIN PLAIN EXTERNAL OTP  GSSAPI SCRAM-SHA-1

These lines show some recommended configurations:

auxprop_plugin:
mech_list:  PLAIN LOGIN

Or
auxprop_plugin:
mech_list:  GSSAPI
