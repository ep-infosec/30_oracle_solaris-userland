There are 2 types of test for libsasl2.

The main test is taken from upstream and wrapped with local scripts.  It
must be run as root, with installed packages.  It tests a wide range of
libsasl functionality, and compares the filtered results to a master file.

-- After gmake publish, do gmake test_tarball.  Obtain a machine with
   a static address and dns, on which you have root access.

-- The directions for testing are in test/README.test, which is also
   included in the tarball.

The other test is for the legacy libsasl-links pkg.  This is to test that our
accommodation for older binaries works.  This test can ONLY be performed on
a SPARC lab machine.  As long as you can install the published packages
this test can be run.

-- Install all sasl packages except libsasl-links

-- Copy /usr/sbin/ldm from 11.3 or earlier OS into /var/tmp or a test
   directory.

   Run ./ldm -V

   Without working legacy links, it gives:

   ld.so.1: ldm: fatal: libsasl.so.1: open failed: No such file or directory
   Killed

   Install libsasl-links

   With working links:

   Failed to connect to logical domain manager: Connection refused

   (Unless, of course, there is an active logical domain manager willing to
   accept the connection.)
