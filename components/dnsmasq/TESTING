Login on the lab machine with installed dnsmasq pkg and follow these steps:

# check dns resolver if not online enable it
svcadm enable svc:/network/dns/client

# check mutualy exclusive services
svcs -H dns/server tftp/udp6 dns/server dhcp/server dhcp/bridge dhcp/relay

# prepare conf
cp /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf.dnsmasq
cat > /etc/dnsmasq.conf <<EOF
interface=lo0
resolv-file=/etc/resolv.conf.dnsmasq
EOF

# change resolver to localhost
svccfg -s svc:/network/dns/client:default setprop config/nameserver = net_address: ::1
svcadm refresh svc:/network/dns/client
# ...and now you can obtain message from ldap_cachemgr falling in Degraded

# enable dnsmasq as local resolver
svcadm enable dnsmasq
# ...and now you can obtain message from ldap_cachemgr Restored service to online

# now you can check dns resolve again including IDN
# note: vm sshroot turns ssh to 8 bit ASCII
dig www.seznam.cz
# Solaris dig do not support IDN unfortunately
 # LC_ALL=utf8 dig háčkyčárky.cz +short +idnin
;; IDN input support not enabled
# so räksmörgås.josefsson.owe can only check as
dig 'xn--rksmrgs-5wao1o.josefsson.org' +short

# now you can check disable dnsmasq
svcadm disable dnsmasq
# ...and retest digs are not working
# note: after reenable ldap_cachemgr definitely goes mad
