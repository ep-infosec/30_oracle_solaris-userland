Several of the pdsh tests fail when run on the Userland build machines
(such as strax and slitheen) from directories under /builds/<username>/
with:

  pdsh@strax: "/builds": World writable and sticky bit is not set

so make sure that you run "gmake test" from a Userland workspace which
is not world writable and the sticky bit is not set.
