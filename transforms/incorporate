#
# We are overloading the org.opensolaris.consolidation package attribute to 
# maintain information about which incorporations a package should belong to.
# This is done by including 'incorporation' decorations in the attribute.
# Ex:
#    set name=org.opensolaris.consolidation value=userland \
#        incorporate=consolidation/userland/userland-incorporation
#
# In the process of package generation, we convert those decorations to
# a separate package attribute (pkg.tmp.incorporate) and drop them from
# the consolidation attribute. A special value of 'none' will cause the
# package to be unincorporated and float freely from the rest of the
# packages.  Note that unincorporated packages don't automatically get
# updated with the rest of the system when 'pkg update' is run unless the
# unincorporated package(s) are specified on the command line.
#

#
# Add a default incorporate decoration if none exists.
#
<transform set name=org.opensolaris.consolidation -> \
    default incorporate consolidation/userland/userland-incorporation>

#
# convert the org.opensolaris.consolidation 'incorporate' attribute
# to a package attribute containing the incorporations that should
# be used in incorporating this package.
#
<transform set name=org.opensolaris.consolidation -> emit \
    set name=pkg.tmp.incorporate \
        value=%(incorporate;sep=' value=')> 

#
# don't incorporate a package that is tagged for unincorporation.
#
<transform set name=pkg.tmp.incorporate value=none -> drop>

#
# Remove any incorporate decoration from the org.opensolaris.consolidation 
# package attribute.
#
<transform set name=org.opensolaris.consolidation -> \
    delete incorporate .*>
