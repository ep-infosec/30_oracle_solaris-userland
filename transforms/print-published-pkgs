# This transform takes package manifest we are about to publish and prints it's
# package name to stdout. This is used by gate automation scripts.

#
# There are packages which are published in our repo but must not propagate to
# release engineering. Those are packages which were used to be translated to
# other languages. We don't have such process anymore. During the build there
# is a log file created holding all the packages which the component just
# created. We must not include such packages into the log
#
<transform set name=pkg.fmri value=pkg:/.*message-files@ -> drop >

# Print the package and FMRI
<transform set name=pkg.fmri value=pkg:/(.+) -> print %<1> >

# Drop everything else
<transform -> drop>
